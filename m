Maybe we can reuse rxbuf_size/txbuf_size to trigger the different
allocation policy:
1.If buf_size equal 0xfffffff, turn on the dynamic allocator
2.If buf_size equall 0, turn on the fixed allocator with the default buffer size
3.otherwise, turn on the fixed allocator with the configed buffer size
So, both requirement could be satisfied without breaking the compatibility.
