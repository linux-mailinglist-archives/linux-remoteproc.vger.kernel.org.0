Agree With Mathieu. More than that it looks to me that the stop ops is not
optional and mandatory to implement the remoteproc shutdown. It should be the
role of the platform driver to decide if a stop is a detachment.

This behavior may also depend on the project for multi purpose platforms. In
this case DT property might be more appropriate than a null stop ops to
determine the behavior.

In current implementation to be able to detach a remote processor we need to be
in RPROC_ATTACHED state. If I well remember the reason is the backup of the
resource table to reinitialize it on detach.should we improve this?

We could also consider the attach and detach as 2 separate features:
- attach is used for a pre loaded firmware (e.g early action use case waiting
Linux boot)
   => can be stopped as a loaded firmware.

- boot a remote firmware loaded from sysfs but detach it on Linux shutdown to
allow it to property stop it own activities (e.g Linux independent reboot).

I'm not sure to understand what would be behind this rework. What is exactly the
issue on the rproc_boot? having a semantic symmetry? In this case do you expect
that the user application determines the current state of the remote processor
and "start" it or "attach" it, depending on state? Or does it be implemented in
rproc_sysfs and rpcroc_cdev (and few platform drivers).

Look to me that take rproc_attach() out of rproc_boot() could break or
complexify some legacy APIs.
