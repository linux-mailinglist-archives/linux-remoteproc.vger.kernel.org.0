Right, it's possible that a previously misconfigured system now
successfully probes more than one device that uses a particular
spinlock. But such system would be suffering from issues related to e.g.
probe ordering.

So I think we should ignore this issue.

There is already an inconsistency in between these; as with above any
system that uses both request() and request_specific() will be suffering
from intermittent failures due to probe ordering.

The case where I can see a
problem with this would be if the two clients somehow would nest their
locking regions.

But generally I think this could consider this an improvement, because
the request_specific() would now be able to acquire its hwlock, with
some additional contention due to the multiple use.

It would be nice to have an upstream user of this API.

I think we should start with #2 and would like input from e.g. Suman
regarding #3.
