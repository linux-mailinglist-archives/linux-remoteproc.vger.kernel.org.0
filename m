Theoretically it is possible for multiple TEE services to be there but
why should a platform/silicon vendor require 2 redundant remoteproc firmware
loading services to be supported? It should either be a service hosted
by the trusted OS or can rather be an independent platform service
running as a FF-A secure partition.
