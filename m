What exactly is the status of the iommu-map stuff and when is it likely 
to land ?

We _already_ have thanks to chromeos a way to define this stuff in venus.

My €0.02 is 100% fine with iommu-map as a solution for VPU but then, 
actually want to see it as part of the series solving the problem.

Else, we should reuse the venus approach.

Right now we have the worst of both worlds. Iris is blocked waiting on 
iommu-map but the iommu-map series has dropped Iris support because - 
reasons.

The very definition of being stuck between a rock and a hard place.

@Mukesh - can you add Iris support back into the series ? If so then is 
it perfectly reasonable to proceed with iommu-map for Iris.

If not then we should just reuse the approach we have.

Either way I regard this series as broken right now, as it applies a 
solution that excludes one of the primary users of that solution with no 
view as to when that user gets enabled, worse still it requires 
adaptation to the new solution but the proposer won't do that work...

It places Iris in a very invidious position.

So again I think if we can agree to add Iris support back into this 
series then we should go ahead with implementing in Iris.

If not then the conclusion is Iris _won't_ use that solution and we go 
with the previous venus solution.

Either way, the proposed series as is, is an effective blocker for Iris 
so I'd like a commitment either to re-add or we agree it won't be added 
at all.

Either way Iris gets unblocked.
