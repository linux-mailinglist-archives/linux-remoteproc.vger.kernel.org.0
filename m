Okay sure, I will remove it.

Not sure what you mean here Mathieu? The reason why we can't use
it is because cdev is an optional feature. We would either have to move
device_add inside rproc_char_dev_add or the other way around and
make cdev a regular feature. Since device_add can't be called on the
same device struct twice[1], we have to do things this way. Also this
way we don't have to rely on the userspace to call mknod as it will
be called[2] as a part of the device_add call in devtmpfs_create_node.

Now that I think about it, is the above what you want me to put in the
commit text? :)

It is a sporadic issue due to a race between the userspace uevent handler
and cdev_add. If the uevent for the device is received/processed after
cdev_add the cdev is created.

If "add" is written to the uevent file or mknod is manually called for devt
the cdev works as expected, just that the sysfs links won't be created.

Sure. I'll make those changes.
