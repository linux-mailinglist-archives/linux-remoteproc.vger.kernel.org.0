Yeah, this series is a result of the discussion on those prior patches, 
and maintaining compatibility for both the current in-kernel usage and 
the OpenAMP usage.

My original usecase was with an out-of-tree driver and is explained as 
part of review of those prior solution,

I am also looking at this for future usage with the rpmsg-chrdev driver.
