the remote processor certainly releases the tx buffer and according to 
my tracing the `vring_interrupt` fires immediately before `rpmsg_send` 
enters the `rpmsg_upref_sleepers`.

after applying this patch we haven't been able to reproduce the 15s 
timeout anymore, whereas before we could easily reproduce it with 
certain workloads.

mentioning locks: i was a bit uncertain about a good way to implement 
the retry, since both `rpmsg_upref_sleepers` and `get_a_tx_buf` both 
acquire the same mutex. i briefly considered to add `get_a_tx_buf` into 
`rpmsg_upref_sleepers` to avoid locking the same mutex multiple times, 
though it adds a bit of complexity to the implementation and harms 
readability a bit.
are there any recommendations on this topic or are (likely 
non-contended) locks not expensive enough to justify the added complexity?

thanks,
tim
