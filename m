Historically, TTY over SMD (I'm basing this on my experience with the
downstream code) has operated in a streaming fasion, where it attempts
to put as much data as will fit in the fifo at that point in time.  So
you would have a "write_size_avail" operation that returns the amount
of free space in the fifo, and then the TTY client would attempt to
write that amount of data into the fifo.

In sort, the fifo size is the maximum that could be put into the
transport, but at any one point in time, there may be data sitting in
the fifo that the remote end has not yet procesed, which would limit
the amount of data you could put in the fifo to fifo_size - size of
data currently sitting in the fifo.

SMD channels have dedicated fifos, and are assumed to be used for a
single client.  If the channel is muxed between multiple clients, and
you want to manage "congestion", that would need to be managed at a
layer above SMD.

Not really.  I think GLINK defines a maximum size that it can handle
as an intent (something like uint32_max), however there is no
guarantee that any particular client will support that.  If you
attempt to have the MTU as the max that GLINK supports, and a client
never queues an intent that large, the data will never be able to be
transmitted.  The MTU is really based on the the whims of the remote
side, and I don't recall if there is a way in the GLINK protocol to
query that.  If I recall correctly, there is a way to request the
remote side queue an intent of a specific size, which the remote side
can either do (success) or reject the request (failure).

In my mind, there should be a valid scenario in which a client can
transmit data of a size equal to the MTU (although the client may need
to wait for that to happen), however I don't have a simple answer on
how to determine that value in a generic way for GLINK.

Thats valid.  If you want MTU, then I think you need to fix the
GLINK/SMD implementations since those are not providing the correct
information.  Unfortunately, GLINK is complicated.  I think Bjorn
should chime in on what he thinks would be valid behavior for GLINK.
