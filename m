Sure, no problem, you got it directly because you were on CC, but it didn't 
make it to the mailing lists - you can check archives, it isn't there :-/ 
But thanks to your reply now it's also on the lists.

I should have a look at the remaining patches from your v1, hopefully my 
problem with sending emails to vger is either already resolved or gets resolved 
very soon.

Yes, this is just the first step in my audio DSP virtualisation patch set, 
once the kernel has a vhost side RPMsg support, I can continue with upstreaming 
of the next step.
