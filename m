My understanding of the topic was that each subdevice should be
independent of the other. In our case unfortunately the sysmon
subdevice depends on the glink endpoint.

However the priority inversion doesn't happen in these
subdevices, it happens due to the SSR notifications that we send
to kernel clients. In this case kernel clients also can have QMI
sockets that in turn depend on the glink endpoint, which means
when they go to release the QMI socket a broadcast will be sent
out to all connected clients about the closure of the connection
which in this case happens to be the remoteproc which died. So
if we peel the onion, we will be unnecessarily be waiting for a
dead remoteproc.

Here the glink device on the rpmsg bus won't know about the
crashed remoteproc till we send glink notification first, right?
Since we send out sysmon and SSR notifications first, the glink
device will still be "alive" on the rpmsg bus.

You are right, the window would become smaller in the case of two
remoteprocs, but this issue can come up with even a single
remoteproc unless prioritize certain subdevices.

Yes you are right, I only changed the others for consistence.
However, I will give this more thought and see if unprepare in
the reverse order can make a difference.
