The synchronous communication channel is already there for each TEE app
based on (invoke commands + TEE shared memory). OP-TEE does support
notification interrupts too but those haven't been exposed to TEE client
drivers yet. I suppose this remoteproc use-case can be a good example to
expose that as a generic TEE notification interface too.

This is really a hard line to draw since silicon/OEM vendors based on their
hardware security architecture partition various resources among TEE and
the Linux world. And one general principle we try to follow for the TEE
is to keep it's Trusted Computing Base (TCB) to a minimal too.

IMHO, if the threat model is well understood then we should allow for
this hetrogenous partitioning of system resources.
