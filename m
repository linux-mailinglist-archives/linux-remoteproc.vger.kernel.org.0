Hi Mathieu,

Sorry for a delayed response, after I'd sent that my message I've 
subscribed to remoteproc and it seems during that transition some 
messages were only delivered from the list and not directly to me 
or something similar has happened.

Yes, the current rpmsg-virtio code does create *one* rpmsg device when 
an NS announcement arrives. Whereas with this patch set the first rpmsg 
device would be created to probe the NS service driver and the next one 
would still be created following the code borrowed from rpmsg-virtio 
when an NS announcement arrives. And I don't see how those two devices 
now make sense, sorry. I understand one device per channel, but two, of 
which one is for a certain endpoing only, whereas other endpoints don't 
create their devices, don't seem very logical to me.

Thanks
Guennadi
