Thank you for all your explanations! It is always very interesting to understand
the different ways to use RPMsg.

In the end, I don't see any problem with your series. The possibility of using
an anonymous inode seems valid to me.

I am just wondering whether this should be implemented in the rpmsg_char driver
or in a new driver, addressing this question to Mathieu and Bjorn.
