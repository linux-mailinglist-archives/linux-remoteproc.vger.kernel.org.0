I don't think there is a way forward with this set without a clear understanding
of the Glink and SMD drivers.  I have already spent a fair amount of time in the
Glink driver and will continue on Monday with SMD.

I doubt you will ever get clear guidelines on the whole solution.  I will get
back to you once I am done with the SMD driver, which should be in the
latter part of next week.
