Right, I meant the dependence of either sysmon or SSR is on QMI,
which in turn depends on glink.

Yes, exactly.

This was implemented downstream as a part of an early
notification that was sent out to the glink device.

I don't think the listeners are doing anything wrong by closing
the QMI handle/QRTR socket, the issue is that the glink device
still thinks that it can communicate.

I say unprepare in any order might not make a difference because
prepare would indicate to the subdevice that it should get its
resources initialized because the remoteproc is going to come up,
so unprepare would only be the subdevice releasing its resources.
However start and stop in the reverse order will make a big
difference. Please correct me if I am wrong.
