No, you are actually right

Hum, if set to 0xFFFFFFFF, then they will be assigned dynamically and updat=
ed
in the resource table (with this patch). But your probably mean existing co=

right ?

Agreed, and actually, I may have missread some code. I can't find were I re=
ad
that. By the way, is there any documentation which state the allowed values=
 of
notify ids ?
