I think the drivers/clk/imx/clk-scu.c (fixed here) does not actually
need it. It uses the feature to create multiple platform devices for
each clock, with unique names matching the clock (e.g. pwm0_clk,
pwm1_clk) and then bind all them via common clock driver.

It looks therefore like something for convenience of debugging or going
through sysfs devices.

Removal of driver_override from such drivers is a bit too much here,
because I would not be able to test it.

Yeah, maybe also my "const" in the title and commit is not accurate. I
think that literal strings are part of .rodata (and objdump confirm)
thus are considered const.
