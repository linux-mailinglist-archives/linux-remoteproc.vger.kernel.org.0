Yes, 
Please tell me if i missed something, the only drawback seems mentioned is the accumulative delay.
Could you elaborate how to implement the delay in remote proc core for multi rproc instance.
Here is my view:
To optimize the delay it would probably be necessary to compute:
- the delay based on an initial date,
- the delay requested by each rproc instance,
- the delay elapsed in each rproc panic ops.
Feasible but not straight forward... 
So I suppose that you are thinking about a solution based on the store of the max delay that would be applied after last panic() return?
anyway, how do you determine the last rproc instance? seems that a prerequisite would be that the panic ops is mandatory... 

I'm not familiar with panic mechanism, but how panic ops are scheduled in SMP? Does panics ops would be treated in parallel (using msleep instead of mdelay)?
In this case delays could not be cumulative...

Yes you are :), this is what i thought, if delay implemented in core.
