That patch was written 8 months ago, what's the timeline for landing
this?

It's not feasible to have every users rebuild crash from source and
maintain this copy in order to use the tool.

This doesn't add any specific value, it's just "Device entered ramdump
mode".

Is this your or Eugen's comment? Why haven't you tested qdl yet?

So these need to be sorted in numerical order, by that number at the end
of the file name?

Do you manually punch these in? How do we make this user friendly?
