This patchset does not introduce any new features - the end result in
terms of functionality is exactly the same.  It is also a carbon copy
of the work introduced by Arnaud (hence reusing his patches), with the
exception that the code is presented in a slightly different order to
allow for a complete dissociation of RPMSG name service from the
virtIO transport mechanic.

To make that happen rpmsg device specific byte conversion operations
had to be introduced in struct rpmsg_device_ops and the explicit
creation of an rpmsg_device associated with the name service (that
wasn't needed when name service was welded to virtIO).  But
associating a rpmsg_device to the name service doesn't change anything
- RPMSG devices are created the same way when name service messages
are received from the host or the remote processor.

To prove my theory I ran the rpmsg_client_sample.c and it just worked,
no changes to client code needed.

Let's keep talking, it's the only way we'll get through this.
