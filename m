Why can't you use HWLOCK_IRQSTATE in this mode?

No it's not.

I think it's typical for hwspinlock hardware to not be able to
distinguish between different clients within Linux, so we would need to
wrap the usage in some construct that ensures mutual exclusion in Linux
- like a spinlock...

But having local lock protection in the hwspinlock driver would defeat
the purpose of HWLOCK_RAW.

Also this kind of warning will at best be consumed by the client driver
authors, it will not be read by the dts authors.
