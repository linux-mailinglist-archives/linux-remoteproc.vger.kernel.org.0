I believe that there is such a notification mechanism implemented by
Qualcomm downstream. Upstream we've so far relied on the fact that the
interfaces exposed by the various rpmsg_devices would be torn down and
re-registered as the remoteproc is restarted.

Same goes with the few cases where we use rpmsg_char, as the channels
are going down the IO operations on the rpmsg endpoint fails to allow
userspace to detect the shutdown part. Then as the new channels appears
userspace will be notified about the newly available channels through
the standard uevents.
