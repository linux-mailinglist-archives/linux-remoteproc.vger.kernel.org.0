Thanks for the review!

Well, I think we are kinda in a dilemma:

- It's bit odd to add anonymous inode code in a file named rpmsg_char.c.

- On the other hand, the new anonymous code path do share couples of
  codes and abstractions of rpmsg_char.c, rpmsg_eptdev, all methods
  excluding open() in fops... . If new code is built into a standalone
  driver, how are we supposed to take care of these shared codes?

Yep, leave it to the maintainers.

Thanks,
