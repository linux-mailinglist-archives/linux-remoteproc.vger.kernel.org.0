We discussed this point with Mathieu, as a first step i kept the class, but that
generated another dependency with the rpmsg_char device while information was
available on the rpmsg bus. The char device and ctrl device should share the
same class. As rpmsg_ctrl is created first it would have to create the class,and
provide an API to rpmsg char

Please could you details what does means "rpmsg_ctrlN doesn't have a
"subsystem"." What exactly the udev is looking for? could it base it check on
the /dev/rpmsg_ctrl0 or /sys/bus/rpmsg/devices/...?

Thanks,
Arnaud
