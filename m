I certainly appreciate to see the upstream kernel be put through the
level of product testing necessary to find issues like this.

Disabling the related interrupt(s) would mean that if the modem
remoteproc firmware crashes while Linux is suspended we would not know
about this until the next time Linux resumes. The expected outcome of
this would be that until something else happens to wake up Linux you
won't get any notifications from the network (i.e. no phone calls, text
messages or incoming notifications)
