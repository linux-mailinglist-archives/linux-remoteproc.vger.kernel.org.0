[Wendy] The TCMs are presented differently in the system depending on
if RPU is in
lockstep or split mode.

Not sure if it is allowed to list TCMs registers properties for both
split mode and lockstep
mode in the same device node.

Even though, driver can have this information in the code, but I feel
the device tree is a
better place for this information.
And also for predefined shared memories, you will need to know the RPU
op mode ahead,
so that you can specify which shared memories belong to which RPU.

To dynamic setup the RPU mode, besides sysfs, setup, if remoteproc can support
device tree overlay, the RPUs can be described with dtbo and loaded at runtime.

Just want to understand the case which needs to set  RPU mode at runtime?
I think testing can be one case.

Best Regards,
Wendy
