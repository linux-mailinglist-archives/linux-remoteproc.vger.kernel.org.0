And we already know that the way we do iommu definitions for both venus
and iris is broken (the non-firmware part).

Please no, this series adds remoteproc support and I think we're ready
to merge the next iteration thereof. There's no reason to conflate the
two topics and delay the introduction of the remoteprocs.

Yes, it requires adaptation, but that's not because of this series, but
because the world has changed.

No, we can merge this series and then turn around and decide to do
exactly what you suggest without further delays - if that's what we
want.

Perhaps I'm misunderstanding what you're saying. How is this blocking
iris support? It adds the support pieces and doesn't touch iris, afaict
the thing blocking iris support is the agreement on how to model the
iommu for iris.
