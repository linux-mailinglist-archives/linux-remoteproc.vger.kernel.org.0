We don't seem to understand each other - the "Virtio and remoteproc" section is
the first thing I red and what made me aware of the rewording.

I have looked at other subsystems documented under Documentation/driver-api and
I can't find instances of the type [subsystem]-kernel-api.rst.  As such I don't
see what is so special about remoteproc that it would mandate adding a new file.
Why can't it just be in a single file like most subsystems do?

> > > +=====================================
> > > +
> > > +The driver must provide the following information to the core:
> > > +
> > > +a. Translate device addresses (physical addresses) found in the ELF
> > > +   firmware to virtual addresses in Linux using the `da_to_va`
> > > +   callback. This allows the framework to copy ELF firmware from the
> > > +   filesystem to the addresses expected by the remote since
> > > +   the framework cannot directly access those physical addresses.
> > > +b. Prepare/unprepare the remote prior to firmware loading,
> > > +   which may involve allocating carveout and reserved memory regions.
> > > +c. Implement methods for starting and stopping the remote,
> > > +   whether by setting registers or sending explicit interrupts,
> > > +   depending on the hardware design.
> > > +d. Provide attach and detach callbacks to start the remote
> > > +   without loading the firmware. This is beneficial when the remote
> > > +   processor is already loaded and running.
> > > +e. Implement a load callback for firmware loading, typically using
> > > +   the ELF loader provided by the framework; currently, only ELF
> > > +   format is supported.
> > > +f. Invoke the framework's crash handler API upon detecting a remote
> > > +   crash.
> > > +
> > > +Drivers must fill the `rproc_ops` structure and call `rproc_alloc`
> > > +to register themselves with the framework.
