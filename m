With Arm FF-A and platforms supporting S-EL2, yes it is possible to run
multiple trusted OS in parallel. However, the recommendation is to then
host the platform specific services as independent FF-A based Secure
Partitions (SPs) which aren't tied to any particular trusted OS. I have
CCed some Arm folks who on the other thread were interested to extend
this driver to support remoteproc service hosted as a FF-A based secure
partition.
