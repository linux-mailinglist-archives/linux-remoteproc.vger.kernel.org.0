This part is not clear to me; could you provide more details?
I cannot figure out why a client can access /dev/rpmsg_ctrlX but not /dev/rpmsgX.

I missed this one, apologize for the duplication.

If we put the optimization aspect aside, what seems strange to me is that the
purpose of rpmsg_char was to expose a FS character device to user space. If we
need tobypass the use of /dev/rpmsgX, does it make sense to support an anonymous
inode in this driver?  I am clearly not legitimate to answer this question...
