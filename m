Thanks for confirming.

I think it would be helpful if we had this properly documented in the
driver, to facilitate reasoning about the various transitions. I'll try
to write down my notes in a patch and send it out.

Right and after reading the stm32 patches, for drivers with a way to
"detach" the remote, i.e. put it back in DETACHED state, a
rmmod/modprobe should conceptually fit very well.

Presumably though the NXP driver wouldn't have a mechanism to "start"
the core, only to "attach" to it. And that would wait for it to be up
and running again.

Do you think that autonomous_recovery would be something that changes
for a given remoteproc instance? I envisioned it as something that you
know at registration time, but perhaps I'm missing some details here.

What I meant was that we add a function "attach" to the existing
rproc_ops. In the case of OFFLINE->RUNNING we continue to call
rproc->ops->start() and DETACHED->RUNNING we call this
rproc->ops->attach().

As I thought about this I saw that the "autonomous" part would only
apply to the scenario where the remote recovers from crashes by itself
(and we just need to be in sync with that). But I've not yet fully
thought through the NXP case of a stopped remote processor restarting by
itself.

I share this belief and am looking forward to v4.
