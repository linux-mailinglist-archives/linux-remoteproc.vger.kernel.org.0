I don't see any impact on Rishabh's change in particular, syntactically
it would just be a matter of adding another flag and the impact would be
separate from his patch.

In other words, creating a separate work queue to get the long running
work off the system_wq and making sure that these doesn't run during
suspend & resume seems very reasonable to me.

The one piece that I'm still contemplating is the HIPRIO, I would like
to better understand the actual impact - or perhaps is this a result of
everyone downstream moving all their work to HIPRIO work queues,
starving the recovery?
