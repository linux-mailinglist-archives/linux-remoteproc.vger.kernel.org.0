I agree with Bjorn, the delay should be provided by the platform.
But in this case i wonder if it is simpler to just let the platform take care it?
For instance for stm32mp1 the stop corresponds to the reset on the remote processor core. To inform the coprocessor about an imminent shutdown we use a signal relying on a mailbox (cf. stm32_rproc_stop).  
In this case we would need a delay between the signal and the reset, but not after (no cache management).
