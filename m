If I well understood your point, the issue occur in following race condition

- all the Tx buffers are used
- in rpmsg_send_offchannel_raw() function, we try to get a buffer using
get_a_tx_buf(vrp) that returns NULL
- rpmsg_xmit_done is called as a Tx buffer is released by the remote processor
  and now free
- in rpmsg_send_offchannel_raw() rpmsg_upref_sleepers is called

At this point you are nothing happen until 15 second because rpmsg_xmit_done is
never called  again that would wake up the waitqueue to call get_a_tx_buf()

I'm right?

If yes what is not clear to me is that wait_event_interruptible_timeout() seems
to test the condition (so call get_a_tx_buf()) before entering in sleep[1]. A
free TX buffer should be found at this step.
