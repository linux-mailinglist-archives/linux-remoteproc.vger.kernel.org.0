Currently an rpmsg_device is created each time a NS announcement is received.

In the current implementation the NS service channel is created automatically
when instantiating an rproc_vdev.  An official rpmsg_device is not needed since
it is implicit.  With this set (and as you noted above) an rpmsg_device to
represent the NS service is registered, the same way other services such as
rpmsg_chrdev are.  After that nothing else changes and no other rpmgs_device
are created until NS request come in.  When an NS request does come in an
rpmsg_device is created, and that for each request that is received.
