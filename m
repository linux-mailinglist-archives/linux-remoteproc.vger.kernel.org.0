I guess that user applications should expect same behavior, regardless of the
backend. So this patch would ensure the check at RPMsg service level.

Regarding virtio implementation we could create a new channel only if either the
channel name, either the local address or the remote address is different.
So a channel would be created only if one address is set to RPMSG_ADDR_ANY.
But could be a nightmare to handle it, in case of multi open/close.

In my opinion the channel should be created only on /dev/rpmsgX creation.

That said, if this patch generates too much discussion. we can also leave it on
hold until figure out how to adapt the RPMsg char for the virtio backend.

Thanks,
Arnaud
