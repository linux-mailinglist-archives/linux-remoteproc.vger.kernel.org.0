I've always seen the rpmsg_endpoint as some form of pipe (with the
special case in virtio rpmsg of it possibly not being connected to
anything) and then the rpmsg_channel being essentially the glue between
a "primary" endpoint and an rpmsg_device.

As such I assumed that it would make sense to do NS announcements of
rpmsg_endpoints in general, not only rpmsg_channels.

What's the context these two sets of channels live in? A separate
rpmsg_device or you're having some userspace entity invoke the
create/destroy during suspend and resume?

Right, I remember expressing the need to extend rpmsg_char (somehow) to
make it possible for userspace to initiate the creation of a channel to
the other side.

It's the part where userspace pokes the kernel, so that the kernel goes
and create the rpmsg_device, which magically ends up probing some driver
that I'm wondering about...

You're correct, it wouldn't allow you to locally create a new
channel/endpoint and have some driver attached to that.
