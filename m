The accesses are initiated by the firmware
and they access modem reserved regions.
However as explained in ^^ any accesses
outside the region will result in a violation
and is controlled through XPUs (protection units).

With ARM_SMMU_DISABLE_BYPASS_BY_DEFAULT y
the firmware SIDs will explicitly need to
be directly mapped to avoid observing
global faults in the absence of secure
firmware (TrustZone) programming the modem
SIDs as S2CR-Bypass.
