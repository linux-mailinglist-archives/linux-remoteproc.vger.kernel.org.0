No problem to add it later. I mentioned it here only trying to have a complete
view of the use cases.

Right, i don't know if it possible to determine boot reason on remoteproc probe.
(first boot or re-boot after crash). This information will be needed to
determine if the firmware has to be re-attached or re-started.

The recovery is a user interface, for my pov the recovery sysfs/debugfs is used
to allow userland to chose behavior on crash
- automatic recovery
- asynchronous recovery ( recovery trigged by the userspace)
- no recovery

As the userspace should be hardware independent, the platform driver should
provide information on the capabilities I list above.
That's why i proposed to not have a boolean but an enum to handle the crash

Yes, my feedback was mainly to determine if the properties allow to cover the
use cases, to avoid to refactor them later. let start with the shutdown.

"autonomous-on-core-shutdown" is fine and sufficient for this series. So as you
suggest let's start with that.

As explained above for the "autonomous-on-remote-crash" property i would prefer
an enum to also be able to prohibit the recovering as well, especially if the
recovering is migrating to the sysfs. let's discuss this in a second step.
