Yeah, OK, we can revisit this. We already have an in-kernel user 
wkup_m3_ipc driver that controls the boot and shutdown of the wkup_m3 
rproc driver, which is used for SoC Power Management, and so we really 
do not want any control from userspace for that. I will have the same 
need for the PRU remoteproc client usage perspective as well.
