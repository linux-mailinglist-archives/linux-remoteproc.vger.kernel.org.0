I would certainly like to see a consensus, and more specifically, an
implementation that follows what other drivers that interact with the
secure world do.  I currently do not have a clear understanding of
what those other drivers do, and doing the research will take
bandwidth that I also currently do not have.  This situation is
expected to persist at least until December.

As such I see two avenues for this patchset:
(1) You seek to find a solution that is amenable to you, Sumit,
Abdellatif and Harshal (I had to add the latter two to this email
thread).
(2) You wait until December, and likely beyond, until I have time to
do the research needed to advise on the way forward.
