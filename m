Sounds good, I share this expectation, just wanted to check with you.

Yes, that's what I meant.

I would prefer that we don't parse_fw(NULL), perhaps we can turn that
upside down and have the platform_driver just provide the information to
the core as it learns about it during probe?

As far as I can see, if we take the approach of introducing the DETACHED
state we can add the various transitions piecemeal. So I'm definitely in
favour of starting off with DETACHED->RUNNING, then figure out
"autonomous recovery" and RUNNING->DETACHED in two subsequent series.

For the action of going from DETACHED->RUNNING I too find "attach" to
better represent what's going on. The part where I think we need
something more is to communicate if it's Linux that's in charge or not
for taking the remote processor through RUNNING->CRASHED->RUNNING. For
that the word "autonomous" makes sense to me, but let's bring that up
again after landing this first piece(s).
