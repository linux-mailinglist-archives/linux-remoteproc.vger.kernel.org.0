Yeah ok. I can add a separate patch fixing that, and couple of these checks then
become redundant.

Most of this is actually tied to auto_boot if you think about it, not just the
rproc state. If we have auto_boot set to false, then rproc_add() would not do
anything, and the decision to start or attach can either be done through the
sysfs/cdev or a kernel remoteproc or some consumer driver. And the state machine
is getting influenced by this flag. auto-boot is a very useful feature.

You are asking is to do things differently between the regular start/stop case
and attach/detach case ignoring the auto-boot. The semantic symmetry actually
makes it easier to follow the state machine given that there are some internal
reference counts as well.

Note that we also have the devres API, and rproc_alloc()/rproc_free() and
rproc_add()/rproc_del() form the main remoteproc subsystem API. The drivers
would end up using matching calls if we don't have auto_boot.

We are talking about a bigger behavioral change to remoteproc core here. So I
would definitely want to hear from others as well on this before we spend any
time reworking code.

Meanwhile, how do I take this series forward? One option I can probably do is
turn off auto-boot for early-boot case in my drivers and do the matching
attach/detach.
