I like it.

If I understand you correctly, that is what Bjorn's original
implementation was doing and it had drawbacks.

> For instance for stm32mp1 the stop corresponds to the reset on the remote processor core. To inform the coprocessor about an imminent shutdown we use a signal relying on a mailbox (cf. stm32_rproc_stop).

Here I believe you are referring to the upper limit of 500ms that is
needed for the mbox_send_message() in stm32_rproc_stop() to complete.
Since that is a blocking call I think it would fit with Bjorn's
proposal above if a value of '0' is returned by rproc->ops->panic().
That would mean no further delays are needed (because the blocking
mbox_send_message() would have done the job already).  Let me know if
I'm in the weeds.
