We are happy to follow what Robin recommended.

This can be summarized in two parts:

Part 1: Writing an SSE-710 reset controller driver

    An SSE-710 reset controller driver that switches on/off the external system.
    The driver will be helpful for products using SSE-710. So whoever licenses
    Corstone-1000 or SSE-710 will find the reset controller driver helpful.
    They can use it with their implementation of the external system.

    Note: It's likely that the external systems the end user will be using in
    their products will be different from the Corstone-1000 external system
    given as an example. Differences in the memory configuration, subsystem
    involved, boot roms configurations, ...
    These differences mean that the end user will need to write their own driver
    which might or might not be a remoteproc driver (e.g: Bluetooth, audio, ...).

Part 2: Corstone-1000 remoteproc driver

    Corstone-1000 HW is being upgraded to support memory sharing between the
    Cortex-A35 (Linux) and the external system (Cortex-M3).

    Once the HW is ready, we can write a Corstone-1000 remoteproc driver able
    to reload the external system firmware and doing communication with the MHUs.
    This remoteproc driver can use the reset subsystem APIs to call the SSE-710
    reset controller driver to switch on/off the external system (already
    developed in part 1).

Impact on the current patchset:

- The current remoteproc patchset will be paused until the HW is upgraded.
- In CY25Q1, I'll send to the mailing list the SSE-710 reset controller bindings
  and a driver under the Reset Controller subsystem.

Thank you for your support and expertise.

Cheers,
Abdellatif
