It is a good point.

Just as a reminder, the need of ST and, I assume, some other companies, is to
have a basic/generic communication channel to control a remote processor
application.

Nothing generic exists today for a virtio transport based implementation.
Companies have to create their own driver.

The purpose of my work is to allow our customer to use RPMsg without developing
a specific driver to control remote applications.

The rpmsg_chrdev char is a good candidate for this. No protocol, just a simple
inter-processor link to send and receive data. The rpmsg_tty is another one.

Focusing on the rpmsg_chrdev:
We did a part of the work with the first patch set that would be in 5.13.
But is it simple to use it for virtio transport based platforms?
If we don't implement the NS announcement support in rpmsg_chrdev, using
rpmsg_chrdev for a user application seems rather tricky.
How to instantiate the communication?
The application will probably has to scan the /sys/bus/rpmsg/devices/ folder to
determine the services and associated remote address.

I don't think the QCOM drivers have the same problem because they seems to
initiate the communication and work directly with the RPMsg endpoints ( new
channel creation on endpoint creation) while Virtio works with the RPMsg channel.

By introducing the ability to instantiate rpmsg_chrdevs through the NS
announcement, we make this easy for applications to use.

And without rpmsg_chrdevs instantiation, It also means that we can't create an
RPMsg channel for the rpmsg_chrdevs using a new RPMSG_CREATE_DEV_IOCTL control,
right?

That said, If we consider that the aim was only to extract the rpmsg_ctrl part,
I'm not against leaving the rpmsg_char in this state and switching to the
rpmsg_tty driver upstream including the work on the rpmsg_ctrl to create rpmsg
channels.

We could come back on this if requested by someone else.

Thanks,
Arnaud
