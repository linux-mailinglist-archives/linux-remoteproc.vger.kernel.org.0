Right, but either you add support for new resource types to the
loading_handlers, or you add the version checks within each handler,
either way you will have to do some work to be compatible with new
versions.

Regarding what resources would be fit for a 64-bit processor probably
relates to many things, in particular the question of what we actually
mean when we say that a coprocessor is 64-bit. So I don't really see a
need for the remoteproc core to prevent someone to design their
system/firmware to have a 64-bit CPU being passed 32-bit addresses.
