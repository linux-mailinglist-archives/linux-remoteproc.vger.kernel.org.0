I apparently didn't spend as much effort as Mathieu thinking about the
details. I do believe that he's right, at least both GLINK and SMD
_should_ return -EBUSY if we try to open an already open channel -
either because the kernel has bound a driver to the channel or because
rpmsg_char already has it opened.

In SMD and GLINK channels are identified solely by their name and hence
it's not possible to have duplicates. As this isn't the case for virtio
I didn't have any objections to it and that's why I asked you to resend
it separately.

But in line with GLINK/SMD, what would the expected behavior be if I
with the virtio backend open a rpmsg_char which is already bound to a
kernel driver?

Do you think we should get another "channel" or do you think the virtio
driver should detect this and return -EBUSY? (I.e. render this patch
unnecessary)
