While creating a new revision of the patchset we tried to implement 
this, but a similar issue comes
up. If at a later point we wish to utilize the functionality of some 
common subdevice (not the case
right now, but potentially), we might run into a similar problem of 
accessing illegal memory using
container_of. I think it might be a better idea to introduce the name in 
the subdevice structure over
having a potential security bug. What do you think?

Thanks,
