I would suggest you take a look at how device specific DT bindings are
used for other discoverable buses like PCIe etc. We need to do the same
for the device/service discoverable on TEE bus.

No, what you describe below still rely on probing over platform bus
(unique compatible). Here you really need to probe remoteproc driver on
TEE bus and then discover DT properties using device specific DT
bindings something like below:

firmware  {
    optee  {
        compatible = "linaro,optee-tz";
        method = "smc";

        rproc-service@0 {
	    compatible = "<rproc-service-UUID>";

            m0_rproc {
	        ...
	    };

            m33_rproc {
	        ...
	    };
	};
    };
};

Note here that you only describe those DT properties which can't be
discovered from rproc OP-TEE service.
