The first version of this set has been released on August 26th and since then,
only you and Peng have given me feedback.  As such I suggest that we move
forward with the decision you and I settle on.  As usual with open source
development, people can submit new patches to enhance our solution as they see
fit.

I'm happy to have this conversation, which is really the point of this second
revision.  I turned names and ideas around in my head for a long time and the above is
the best I came up with.  Your insight gave me food for thought - see below.

Right - I think "autonomous-on-core-boot" would be best as it really spells out
what is going on. I did not include it in the "attach" patchset because there
wasn't a need for it.  Both ST and NXP are able to determine the state of the
remote processor from a platform driver.  My initial strategy was to introduce
the functionality when the need for it comes up.  I can revisit if you feel
strongly about adding it immediately.

That is what the "autonomous-on-core-reboot" was for but reading your
description I think "autonomous-on-core-shutdown" is best to describe the
scenario.

As far as I can tell nothing happens to drivers when the kernel crashes.  To
take action when the kernel crashes each driver needs to register explicitly
with the panic notifier, which the remoteproc doesn't currently do.  That's a
different feature that I would like to delay for another time.

If and when that time comes we can either reuse "autonomous-on-core-shutdown"
or introduce "autonomous-on-core-crash", depending on the level of granularity
needed.

That is currently the default behavior _if_ recovery is enabled.

That is how I intend to use "autonomous-on-remote-crash", _if_ recovery is
enabled.

That is the current behavior if recovery is _not_ enabled.

Dealing with crash scenarios is a little more complex and requires some
refactoring.  That is why I wanted to solely concentrate on the shutdown scenario
in this set.

I think that falls in the same category as power management and is too specific
to be handled in the remoteproc core.  As you suggest, it is probably best to
leave that to platform drivers for the time being.

I think all of the above scenarios can be managed with a combination of the
proposed bindings , i.e "autonomous-on-core-shutdown" and
"autonomous-on-remote-crash".  The latter would be used in conjuction with the
recovery mechanic already available. 

Let me know what you think.
