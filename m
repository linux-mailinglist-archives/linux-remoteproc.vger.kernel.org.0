"remote controlled" as in "someone else is managing the remote processor" ?  It
could also mean the remoteproc core is "remote controlling" the remote
processor, exactly what it currently does today...

How about "autonomous", as in the remote processor doesn't need us to boot or
switch it off.  I'm open to any other suggestions.

I suggested that at some point in the past but it was in a different context.  I
will revisit to see how doing so could apply here.

It tells the remoteproc core how to interact with the remote processor after the
latter has been switched off.  For example, we could want to boot the remote
processor from the boot loader so that minimal functionality can be provided
while the kernel boots.  Once the kernel and user space are in place, the remote
processor is explicitly stopped and booted once again, but this time with a
firmware image that offers full functionality.

It could also be that the remoteproc core can stop the remote processor, but the
remote processor will automatically reboot itself.  In that case the remoteproc
core will simply synchronise with the remote processor, as it does when .on_init
== true.

The exact same sequence of steps will be carried out as they are today, except
that if after_crash == true, the remoteproc core won't be switching the remote
processor on, exactly as it would do when on_init == true.

These flags are there to indicate how to set rproc::sync_with_rproc after
different events, that is when the remoteproc core boots, when the remoteproc
has been stopped or when it has crashed.

That is the approach Loic took in a previous patchset [1] and that was rejected.
It also lead to all of the platform drivers testing rproc->flag before carring
different actions, something you indicated could be done in the core.  This
patch does exactly that, i.e move the testing of rproc->flag to the core and
calls the right function based on that.

The end result is the same and I'm happy with one or the other, I will need to
know which one.

The advantage with the approach I'm proposing is that everything is controlled
in the core, i.e what ops is called and when to set rproc->flag based on
different states the remote processor transitions through.

Thanks,
Mathieu
