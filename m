 Remote Processor Framework
 ==========================
 
-Introduction
-============
-
-Modern SoCs typically have heterogeneous remote processor devices in asymmetric
-multiprocessing (AMP) configurations, which may be running different instances
-of operating system, whether it's Linux or any other flavor of real-time OS.
-
-OMAP4, for example, has dual Cortex-A9, dual Cortex-M3 and a C64x+ DSP.
-In a typical configuration, the dual cortex-A9 is running Linux in a SMP
-configuration, and each of the other three cores (two M3 cores and a DSP)
-is running its own instance of RTOS in an AMP configuration.
-
-The remoteproc framework allows different platforms/architectures to
-control (power on, load firmware, power off) those remote processors while
-abstracting the hardware differences, so the entire driver doesn't need to be
-duplicated. In addition, this framework also adds rpmsg virtio devices
-for remote processors that supports this kind of communication. This way,
-platform-specific remoteproc drivers only need to provide a few low-level
-handlers, and then all rpmsg drivers will then just work
-(for more information about the virtio-based rpmsg bus and its drivers,
-please read Documentation/staging/rpmsg.rst).
-Registration of other types of virtio devices is now also possible. Firmwares
-just need to publish what kind of virtio devices do they support, and then
-remoteproc will add those devices. This makes it possible to reuse the
-existing virtio drivers with remote processor backends at a minimal development
-cost.
-
-User API
-========
-
-::
-
-  int rproc_boot(struct rproc *rproc)
-
-Boot a remote processor (i.e. load its firmware, power it on, ...).
-
-If the remote processor is already powered on, this function immediately
-returns (successfully).
-
-Returns 0 on success, and an appropriate error value otherwise.
-Note: to use this function you should already have a valid rproc
-handle. There are several ways to achieve that cleanly (devres, pdata,
-the way remoteproc_rpmsg.c does this, or, if this becomes prevalent, we
-might also consider using dev_archdata for this).
-
-::
-
-  void rproc_shutdown(struct rproc *rproc)
-
-Power off a remote processor (previously booted with rproc_boot()).
-In case @rproc is still being used by an additional user(s), then
-this function will just decrement the power refcount and exit,
-without really powering off the device.
-
-Every call to rproc_boot() must (eventually) be accompanied by a call
-to rproc_shutdown(). Calling rproc_shutdown() redundantly is a bug.
-
-.. note::
-
-  we're not decrementing the rproc's refcount, only the power refcount.
-  which means that the @rproc handle stays valid even after
-  rproc_shutdown() returns, and users can still use it with a subsequent
-  rproc_boot(), if needed.
-
-::
-
-  struct rproc *rproc_get_by_phandle(phandle phandle)
-
-Find an rproc handle using a device tree phandle. Returns the rproc
-handle on success, and NULL on failure. This function increments
-the remote processor's refcount, so always use rproc_put() to
-decrement it back once rproc isn't needed anymore.
-
-Typical usage
-=============
-
-::
-
-  #include <linux/remoteproc.h>
-
-  /* in case we were given a valid 'rproc' handle */
-  int dummy_rproc_example(struct rproc *my_rproc)
-  {
-	int ret;
-
-	/* let's power on and boot our remote processor */
-	ret = rproc_boot(my_rproc);
-	if (ret) {
-		/*
-		 * something went wrong. handle it and leave.
-		 */
-	}
-
-	/*
-	 * our remote processor is now powered on... give it some work
-	 */
-
-	/* let's shut it down now */
-	rproc_shutdown(my_rproc);
-  }
-
-API for implementors
-====================
-
-::
-
-  struct rproc *rproc_alloc(struct device *dev, const char *name,
-				const struct rproc_ops *ops,
-				const char *firmware, int len)
-
-Allocate a new remote processor handle, but don't register
-it yet. Required parameters are the underlying device, the
-name of this remote processor, platform-specific ops handlers,
-the name of the firmware to boot this rproc with, and the
-length of private data needed by the allocating rproc driver (in bytes).
-
-This function should be used by rproc implementations during
-initialization of the remote processor.
-
-After creating an rproc handle using this function, and when ready,
-implementations should then call rproc_add() to complete
-the registration of the remote processor.
-
-On success, the new rproc is returned, and on failure, NULL.
-
-.. note::
-
-  **never** directly deallocate @rproc, even if it was not registered
-  yet. Instead, when you need to unroll rproc_alloc(), use rproc_free().
-
-::
-
-  void rproc_free(struct rproc *rproc)
-
-Free an rproc handle that was allocated by rproc_alloc.
-
-This function essentially unrolls rproc_alloc(), by decrementing the
-rproc's refcount. It doesn't directly free rproc; that would happen
-only if there are no other references to rproc and its refcount now
-dropped to zero.
-
-::
-
-  int rproc_add(struct rproc *rproc)
-
-Register @rproc with the remoteproc framework, after it has been
-allocated with rproc_alloc().
-
-This is called by the platform-specific rproc implementation, whenever
-a new remote processor device is probed.
-
-Returns 0 on success and an appropriate error code otherwise.
-Note: this function initiates an asynchronous firmware loading
-context, which will look for virtio devices supported by the rproc's
-firmware.
-
-If found, those virtio devices will be created and added, so as a result
-of registering this remote processor, additional virtio drivers might get
-probed.
-
-::
-
-  int rproc_del(struct rproc *rproc)
-
-Unroll rproc_add().
-
-This function should be called when the platform specific rproc
-implementation decides to remove the rproc device. it should
-_only_ be called if a previous invocation of rproc_add()
-has completed successfully.
-
-After rproc_del() returns, @rproc is still valid, and its
-last refcount should be decremented by calling rproc_free().
-
-Returns 0 on success and -EINVAL if @rproc isn't valid.
-
-::
-
-  void rproc_report_crash(struct rproc *rproc, enum rproc_crash_type type)
-
-Report a crash in a remoteproc
-
-This function must be called every time a crash is detected by the
-platform specific rproc implementation. This should not be called from a
-non-remoteproc driver. This function can be called from atomic/interrupt
-context.
-
-Implementation callbacks

+
+1. Introduction
+===============
+
+Modern System on Chips (SoCs) typically integrate heterogeneous remote
+processor devices in asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP) configurations.
+These processors may run different operating systems, such as Linux and
+various real-time operating systems (RTOS).
+
+For example, the OMAP4 platform features dual Cortex-A9 cores, dual
+Cortex-M3 cores, and a C64x+ DSP. In a standard setup, the Cortex-A9
+cores execute Linux in a symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) configuration,
+while the M3 cores and DSP run independent instances of an RTOS.
+
+The remoteproc framework allows various platforms and architectures to
+manage remote processors, including operations such as powering on,
+loading firmware, and powering off. This framework abstracts hardware
+differences, promoting code reuse and minimizing duplication. It also
+supports rpmsg virtio devices for remote processors that utilize this
+communication method. Consequently, platform-specific remoteproc drivers
+need only implement a few low-level handlers, enabling seamless operation
+of all rpmsg drivers. (For more details about the virtio-based rpmsg
+bus and its drivers, refer to rpmsg documentation.)
+
+Additionally, the framework allows for the registration of various
+virtio devices. Firmware can publish the types of virtio devices it
+supports, facilitating their addition to the remoteproc framework. This
+flexibility enables the reuse of existing virtio drivers with remote
+processor backends at minimal development cost.
+
+The primary purpose of the remoteproc framework is to download firmware
+for remote processors and manage their lifecycle. The framework consists
+of several key components:
+
+- **Character Driver**: Provides userspace access to control the remote
+  processor.
+- **ELF Utility**: Offers functions for handling ELF files and managing
+  resources requested by the remote processor.
+- **Remoteproc Core**: Manages firmware downloads and recovery actions
+  in case of a remote processor crash.
+- **Coredump**: Provides facilities for coredumping and tracing from
+  the remote processor in the event of a crash.
+- **Userspace Interaction**: Uses sysfs and debugfs to manage the
+  lifecycle and status of the remote processor.
+- **Virtio Support**: Facilitates interaction with the virtio and
+  rpmsg bus.
+
+From here on, references to "framework" denote the remoteproc
+framework, and "driver" refers to the remoteproc driver that utilizes
+the framework for managing remote processors.
+
+2. Remoteproc framework Responsibilities
+========================================
+
+The framework begins by gathering information about the firmware file
+to be downloaded through the request_firmware function. It supports
+the ELF format and parses the firmware image to identify the physical
+addresses that need to be populated from the corresponding ELF sections.
+The framework also requires knowledge of the logical or I/O-mapped
+addresses in the application processor. Once this information is
+obtained from the driver, the framework transfers the data to the
+specified addresses and starts the remote, along with
+any devices physically or logically connected to it.
+
+Dependent devices, referred to as `subdevices` within the framework,
+are also managed post-registration by their respective drivers.
+Subdevices can register themselves using `rproc_(add/remove)_subdev`.
+Non-remoteproc drivers can use subdevices as a way to logically connect
+to remote and get lifecycle notifications of the remote.
+
+The framework oversees the lifecycle of the remote and
+provides the `rproc_report_crash` function, which the driver invokes
+upon receiving a crash notification from the remote. The
+notification method can differ based on the design of the remote
+processor and its communication with the application processor. For
+instance, if the remote is a DSP equipped with a watchdog,
+unresponsive behavior triggers the watchdog, generating an interrupt
+that routes to the application processor, allowing it to call
+`rproc_report_crash` in the driver's interrupt context.
+
+During crash handling, the framework performs the following actions:
+
+a. Sends a request to stop the remote and any connected or
+   dependent subdevices.
+b. Generates a coredump, dumping all `resources` requested by the
+   remote alongside relevant debugging information. Resources are
+   explained below.
+c. Reloads the firmware and restarts the remote.
+
+If the `RPROC_FEAT_ATTACH_ON_RECOVERY` flag is set, the detach and
+attach callbacks of the driver are invoked without reloading the
+firmware. This is useful when the remote requires no
+assistance for recovery, or when the application processor can restart
+independently. After recovery, the application processor can reattach
+to the remote.
+
+The remote can request resources from the framework, which
+allocates a ".resource_table" section. During the ELF parsing phase,
+the framework identifies this section and calls the appropriate
+handler to allocate the requested resources.
+
+Resource management within the framework can accommodate any type of
+`fw_resource_type`.
+
+.. code-block:: c
+
+   enum fw_resource_type {
+       RSC_CARVEOUT      = 0,
+       RSC_DEVMEM        = 1,
+       RSC_TRACE         = 2,
+       RSC_VDEV          = 3,
+       RSC_LAST          = 4,
+       RSC_VENDOR_START  = 128,
+       RSC_VENDOR_END    = 512,
+   };
+
+   struct resource_table {
+       u32 ver;
+       u32 num;
+       u32 reserved[2];
+       u32 offset[];
+   } __packed;
+
+   struct fw_rsc_hdr {
+       u32 type;
+       u8 data[];
+   } __packed;
+
+For example, if the remote requests both `RSC_TRACE` and
+`RSC_CARVEOUT` for memory allocation, the ELF firmware can be structured
+as follows:
+
+.. code-block:: c
+
+   #define MAX_SHARED_RESOURCE 2
+   #define LOG_BUF_SIZE 1000
+   #define CARVEOUT_DUMP_PA 0x12345678
+   #define CARVEOUT_DUMP_SIZE 2000
+
+   struct shared_resource_table {
+       u32 ver;
+       u32 num;
+       u32 reserved[2];
+       u32 offset[MAX_SHARED_RESOURCE];
+       struct fw_rsc_trace log_trace;
+       struct fw_rsc_carveout dump_carveout;
+   };
+
+   volatile struct shared_resource_table table = {
+       .ver = 1,
+       .num = 2,
+       .reserved = {0, 0},
+       .offset = {
+           offsetof(struct resource_table, log_trace),
+           offsetof(struct resource_table, dump_carveout),
+       },
+       .log_trace = {
+           RSC_TRACE,
+           (u32)log_buf, LOG_BUF_SIZE, 0, "log_trace",
+       },
+       .dump_carveout = {
+           RSC_CARVEOUT,
+           (u32)FW_RSC_ADDR_ANY, CARVEOUT_PA, 0, "carveout_dump",
+       },
+   };
+
+The framework creates a sysfs file when it encounters the `RSC_TRACE`
+type to expose log information to userspace. Other resource types are
+handled accordingly. In the example above, `CARVEOUT_DUMP_SIZE` bytes
+of DMA memory will be allocated starting from `CARVEOUT_DUMP_PA`.
+
+
+3. Remoteproc driver responsibilities
+=====================================
+
+The driver must provide the following information to the core:
+
+a. Translate device addresses (physical addresses) found in the ELF
+   firmware to virtual addresses in Linux using the `da_to_va`
+   callback. This allows the framework to copy ELF firmware from the
+   filesystem to the addresses expected by the remote since
+   the framework cannot directly access those physical addresses.
+b. Prepare/unprepare the remote prior to firmware loading,
+   which may involve allocating carveout and reserved memory regions.
+c. Implement methods for starting and stopping the remote,
+   whether by setting registers or sending explicit interrupts,
+   depending on the hardware design.
+d. Provide attach and detach callbacks to start the remote
+   without loading the firmware. This is beneficial when the remote
+   processor is already loaded and running.
+e. Implement a load callback for firmware loading, typically using
+   the ELF loader provided by the framework; currently, only ELF
+   format is supported.
+f. Invoke the framework's crash handler API upon detecting a remote
+   crash.
+
+Drivers must fill the `rproc_ops` structure and call `rproc_alloc`
+to register themselves with the framework.
+
+.. code-block:: c
+
+   struct rproc_ops {
+       int (*prepare)(struct rproc *rproc);
+       int (*unprepare)(struct rproc *rproc);
+       int (*start)(struct rproc *rproc);
+       int (*stop)(struct rproc *rproc);
+       int (*attach)(struct rproc *rproc);
+       int (*detach)(struct rproc *rproc);
+       void * (*da_to_va)(struct rproc *rproc, u64 da, size_t len,
+                          bool *is_iomem);
+       int (*parse_fw)(struct rproc *rproc, const struct firmware *fw);
+       int (*handle_rsc)(struct rproc *rproc, u32 rsc_type,
+                         void *rsc, int offset, int avail);
+       int (*load)(struct rproc *rproc, const struct firmware *fw);

+4. Virtio and Remoteproc
 ========================
 
-These callbacks should be provided by platform-specific remoteproc
-drivers::
-
-  /**
-   * struct rproc_ops - platform-specific device handlers
-   * @start:	power on the device and boot it
-   * @stop:	power off the device
-   * @kick:	kick a virtqueue (virtqueue id given as a parameter)
-   */
-  struct rproc_ops {
-	int (*start)(struct rproc *rproc);
-	int (*stop)(struct rproc *rproc);
-	void (*kick)(struct rproc *rproc, int vqid);
-  };
-
-Every remoteproc implementation should at least provide the ->start and ->stop
-handlers. If rpmsg/virtio functionality is also desired, then the ->kick handler
-should be provided as well.
-
-The ->start() handler takes an rproc handle and should then power on the
-device and boot it (use rproc->priv to access platform-specific private data).
-The boot address, in case needed, can be found in rproc->bootaddr (remoteproc
-core puts there the ELF entry point).
-On success, 0 should be returned, and on failure, an appropriate error code.
-
-The ->stop() handler takes an rproc handle and powers the device down.
-On success, 0 is returned, and on failure, an appropriate error code.
-
-The ->kick() handler takes an rproc handle, and an index of a virtqueue
-where new message was placed in. Implementations should interrupt the remote
-processor and let it know it has pending messages. Notifying remote processors
-the exact virtqueue index to look in is optional: it is easy (and not
-too expensive) to go through the existing virtqueues and look for new buffers
-in the used rings.
-
-Binary Firmware Structure
-=========================
-
-At this point remoteproc supports ELF32 and ELF64 firmware binaries. However,
-it is quite expected that other platforms/devices which we'd want to
-support with this framework will be based on different binary formats.
-
-When those use cases show up, we will have to decouple the binary format
-from the framework core, so we can support several binary formats without
-duplicating common code.
-
-When the firmware is parsed, its various segments are loaded to memory
-according to the specified device address (might be a physical address
-if the remote processor is accessing memory directly).
-
-In addition to the standard ELF segments, most remote processors would
-also include a special section which we call "the resource table".
-
-The resource table contains system resources that the remote processor
-requires before it should be powered on, such as allocation of physically
-contiguous memory, or iommu mapping of certain on-chip peripherals.
-Remotecore will only power up the device after all the resource table's
-requirement are met.
-
-In addition to system resources, the resource table may also contain
-resource entries that publish the existence of supported features
-or configurations by the remote processor, such as trace buffers and
-supported virtio devices (and their configurations).
-
-The resource table begins with this header::
-
-  /**
-   * struct resource_table - firmware resource table header
-   * @ver: version number
-   * @num: number of resource entries
-   * @reserved: reserved (must be zero)
-   * @offset: array of offsets pointing at the various resource entries
-   *
-   * The header of the resource table, as expressed by this structure,
-   * contains a version number (should we need to change this format in the
-   * future), the number of available resource entries, and their offsets
-   * in the table.
-   */
-  struct resource_table {
-	u32 ver;
-	u32 num;
-	u32 reserved[2];
-	u32 offset[0];
-  } __packed;
-
-Immediately following this header are the resource entries themselves,
-each of which begins with the following resource entry header::
-
-  /**
-   * struct fw_rsc_hdr - firmware resource entry header
-   * @type: resource type
-   * @data: resource data
-   *
-   * Every resource entry begins with a 'struct fw_rsc_hdr' header providing
-   * its @type. The content of the entry itself will immediately follow
-   * this header, and it should be parsed according to the resource type.
-   */
-  struct fw_rsc_hdr {
-	u32 type;
-	u8 data[0];
-  } __packed;
-
-Some resources entries are mere announcements, where the host is informed
-of specific remoteproc configuration. Other entries require the host to
-do something (e.g. allocate a system resource). Sometimes a negotiation
-is expected, where the firmware requests a resource, and once allocated,
-the host should provide back its details (e.g. address of an allocated
-memory region).
-
-Here are the various resource types that are currently supported::
-
-  /**
-   * enum fw_resource_type - types of resource entries
-   *
-   * @RSC_CARVEOUT:   request for allocation of a physically contiguous
-   *		    memory region.
-   * @RSC_DEVMEM:     request to iommu_map a memory-based peripheral.
-   * @RSC_TRACE:	    announces the availability of a trace buffer into which
-   *		    the remote processor will be writing logs.
-   * @RSC_VDEV:       declare support for a virtio device, and serve as its
-   *		    virtio header.
-   * @RSC_LAST:       just keep this one at the end
-   * @RSC_VENDOR_START:	start of the vendor specific resource types range
-   * @RSC_VENDOR_END:	end of the vendor specific resource types range
-   *
-   * Please note that these values are used as indices to the rproc_handle_rsc
-   * lookup table, so please keep them sane. Moreover, @RSC_LAST is used to
-   * check the validity of an index before the lookup table is accessed, so
-   * please update it as needed.
-   */
-  enum fw_resource_type {
-	RSC_CARVEOUT		= 0,
-	RSC_DEVMEM		= 1,
-	RSC_TRACE		= 2,
-	RSC_VDEV		= 3,
-	RSC_LAST		= 4,
-	RSC_VENDOR_START	= 128,
-	RSC_VENDOR_END		= 512,
-  };
-
-For more details regarding a specific resource type, please see its
-dedicated structure in include/linux/remoteproc.h.
-
-We also expect that platform-specific resource entries will show up
-at some point. When that happens, we could easily add a new RSC_PLATFORM
-type, and hand those resources to the platform-specific rproc driver to handle.
-
-Virtio and remoteproc
-=====================
-
-The firmware should provide remoteproc information about virtio devices
-that it supports, and their configurations: a RSC_VDEV resource entry
-should specify the virtio device id (as in virtio_ids.h), virtio features,
-virtio config space, vrings information, etc.
-
-When a new remote processor is registered, the remoteproc framework
-will look for its resource table and will register the virtio devices
-it supports. A firmware may support any number of virtio devices, and
-of any type (a single remote processor can also easily support several
-rpmsg virtio devices this way, if desired).
-
-Of course, RSC_VDEV resource entries are only good enough for static
-allocation of virtio devices. Dynamic allocations will also be made possible
-using the rpmsg bus (similar to how we already do dynamic allocations of
-rpmsg channels; read more about it in rpmsg.txt).
+The firmware must provide remoteproc with information regarding the
+virtio devices it supports and their configurations: an `RSC_VDEV`
+resource entry should detail the virtio device ID (as defined in
+`virtio_ids.h`), virtio features, virtio config space, vrings
+information, etc.
+
+Upon registration of a new remote, the remoteproc framework
+searches for its resource table and registers the supported virtio
+devices. A firmware may support multiple virtio devices, of various
+types (a single remote can support multiple rpmsg virtio
+devices if required).
+
+Moreover, `RSC_VDEV` resource entries suffice for static allocation
+of virtio devices. Dynamic allocations will also be supported using
+the rpmsg bus, akin to the handling of dynamic allocations for rpmsg
+channels. For more information, refer to rpmsg documentation.
