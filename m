I am unsure how to move forward here. It seems to me that addressing Sumit's
request for a TEE without a device tree is not compatible with the current
OP-TEE implementation, at least for the STM32MP platforms.

Perhaps the simplest approach is to abandon the effort to make this generic
and instead rename tee_remoteproc.c to stm32_tee_remoteproc.c, making it
platform-dependent. Then, if another platform wants to reuse it with OP-TEE
FFA or another TEE, the file can be renamed.

Does this proposal would make sense to you?

Thanks and Regards,
Arnaud
