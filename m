Sorry, missed the "second half" of your reply.

The way the kernel is written now, it's perfectly reasonable to expect
that error handling happens and these pointers ends up in a state where
we will perform a NULL pointer dereference. This is a bug and should be
fixed.

What I'm saying is that I don't think we have a clearly defined
requirement of how error handling in stop() should be handled.

You're patch is taking one swing at a game of whack-a-mole, but we
haven't defined if that is the game we're playing.

Exactly, there's nothing saying that a remoteproc driver's stop()
callback should be callable again after returning an error.

The outcome today is undefined.

I think we need to define the outcome, either by saying that stop() (and
all involved parts) might be called again on an error, or by marking the
remoteproc to be in an "undefined" state (what you called defunced in
v3).

I think we can get the Qualcomm platform into a state where things
really are in an unknown state (like when some of the access control
operations fails). So we might need to introduce that anyways.

But there will be a category of recoverable errors, so I think we should
handle these in a predictable way.

The current error path is broken, so we should certainly fix that (in
some way).


In parallel to that, I'd like qcom_pas_stop() not to fail with "Invalid
argument" if we have a recoverable error - at least.

I would also like to know what the frequency of this error is, so we can
consider if rproc_trigger_recovery() should perform a delayed retry.
