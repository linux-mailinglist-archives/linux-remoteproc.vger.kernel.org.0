I specifically think it is the wrong thing to do, to drop video 
enablement from this series.

Its just papering over the cracks. The right thing to do is to have the 
technical disucssion and agree a way forward, not to drop things that 
feel too contentious.

What's really so contentious about

video-firmware {
	iommu data here
};

As has been done with ChromeOS on venus thus far ?

All that has to be made is a case for it.
