I don't envision any of the transision flags to change once they are set by the
platform.   The same applies to the new rproc_ops, it can be set only once.
Otherwise combination of possible scenarios becomes too hard to manage, leading
to situations where the core and MCU get out of sync and can't talk to each
other.

If I read the above properly we'd end up with:

struct rproc_ops {
	int (*start)(struct rproc *rproc);
	int (*stop)(struct rproc *rproc);
	int (*attach)(struct rproc *rproc);
	int (*detach)(struct rproc *rproc);
        ...
        ...
};

But wed'd have to deal with other operations that are common to both scenarios
such as parse_fw() and find_loaded_rsc_table().  

So far lot of improvement have already been suggested on this revision.  I
suggest to spin off a new patchset that only handles the DETACHED->RUNNING
scenario and split common functions such as rproc_fw_boot().  From there we can
see if other refinements (such as what you suggest above) are mandated.

One last thing...  Upon reflecting on all this I think using "attach" is better
than "autonomous", the latter is heavy to drag around.

Mathieu
