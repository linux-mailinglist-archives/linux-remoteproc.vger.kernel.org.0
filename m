I think so, see for example in CAF 4.9 [1]

As far as I can tell, the QMI TMD service was written specifically *for*
the cooling_device API, so it's a bit of a chicken and egg problem
trying to coerce it to some other form...

That all being said, I can definitely see the potential value in using
the powercap framework. Especially if it would let us tie the TMD
controls more directly with the remoteproc device and more easily
integrate it with DTPM.

For example, would it also make sense to adjust these values to preserve
battery life? Which API makes the most sense for that?
