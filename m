That's the opposite actually. I have one remote processor which is 
general-purpose, and as such userspace may or may not want it started 
at boot time - depending on what it wants to do with it. The kernel 
shouldn't decide itself whether or not the remote processor should be 
started, because that's policy.

Hardcoded in the platform driver or flagged in the device tree, doesn't 
change the fundamental problem - it should be up to the userspace to 
decide whether or not the remote processor should boot.

Cheers,
