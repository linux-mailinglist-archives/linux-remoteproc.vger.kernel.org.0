My concern here is that the resource table can be uncorrelated from the Firmware.
For instance the remote proc firmware could run autonomously.
In this case only the resource table will be managed.
Should we consider that this resource table must be reloaded on a stop/start from application?
Now regarding the da that is also reset to 0 (instead of FW_RSC_ADDR_ANY) in rproc_free_vring, i suppose that
my scenario is not realistic...on restart rproc would try to allocate vring at address 0, Leading to a crash.

point also not clear for me. In existing code the notifyids is always overwritten.
Mathieu could you details what you have in mind here?

0 seems a valid value. I'm not aware about a constraint on the notify ID.
With the current implementation, the initial values are simply ignored, therefore do not seem to be a problem.    
With Clément's patch, the issue is for legacy firmwares with both vrings IDs initialized to the same value (0 or another value different from -1).
The rproc_alloc_vring fails while trying to reserve the same IDs for both vring.
If this patch is introduced with a new version of the resource table a constraint on the notiifyID seems acceptable.

Thanks,
Arnaud
