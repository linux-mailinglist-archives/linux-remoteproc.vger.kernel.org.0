Nice proposal!

I've also had the same approach in mind for a while, to remove the use of
dma_declare_coherent_memory in remoteproc_virtio[1][2].
But I haven't found the time to implement it yet.

It would be nice to ensure same approach for the different virtio
backend (remoteproc_virtio, virtio_mmio, ...) to be able to reuse the virtio
drivers on top of.

The virtio_mmio seems the reference...

The DT seems to me a valid place to define memory regions associated.
It can be one for vrings and buffers, or one unique pool.
One reason is that the main processor can have to specify the memory mapping
and to specify associated access right.

Great!

Good question...I don't have the answer.
I have implemented something different but not fully satisfied. For instance how
to manage the remoteproc address (DA) and CPU address(PA) conversion for vring
descriptor?

You can have a look to the work I started, described in the cover letter[3]] with
links to my github for the code source.
I have only up-streamed the step 1 yet.
We have some discussions in the OpenAMP project to reuse the virtio MMIO. So I
put on hold waiting more clues.
