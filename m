On Linux there are two devices managed by qcom_q6v5_mss, the platform
device used by the driver and the actual remoteproc instance that has
the state. The devices that follow the state are children of the
remoteproc instance. I'm creating BAM-DMUX below the platform device.

This is just not represented in the device tree very well since both
platform device and remoteproc instance share the same device tree node.
However, all the state managed nodes are manually managed and do not
have a compatible so it should not cause problems.

I had it at / originally and at the moment it would still work there.
I moved it below the remoteproc when the whole "WWAN subsystem"
discussion came up. The goal is to have a common parent device for all
the ports of a WWAN modem.

The way it works is that you give the WWAN subsystem a (parent) device
that represents the modem itself, and then it groups all WWAN ports
below that. The control ports (rpmsg_wwan_ctrl driver) are currently
already created below the modem platform device.

The bam-dmux driver does not integrate with the WWAN subsystem yet
because of some unrelated open problems, but in the future I will likely
need a reference to the modem platform device there as well.

There are other approaches of course (e.g. a phandle to the modem
remoteproc node), but I still think it logically fits best somewhere
below the modem node. If the modem remoteproc is status = "disabled",
it does not make sense to load bam-dmux either etc.

Thanks,
Stephan
