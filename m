Imagine rather the equivalent of struct rpmsg_hdr carrying a "type"
field to specify if the payload is data, channel open, close, open_ack,
close_ack and flow control commands.

I.e. only "data" will be passed up to the client, the other types of
messages are interpreted internally.

Correct, it's the responsibility of the backend to exchange the flow
control signals.

In the case of GLINK flow control is inband control messages, for SMD
it's status bits in a fixed located "per-channel information struct".
And when we have talked about introducing this for virtio we have toyed
with the idea of creating a single control channel to exchange them.

So I don't think we have the ability to push the implementation itself
into the core, but I think if we define a small set of well defined
operations (such as flow on/off), it should be fairly straight forward
to implement these in the backend.

In the case of the two Qualcomm protocols we simply have been ignoring
them upstream and Qualcomm have carried downstream patches adding this
functionality.

This has worked out okay, because in addition to the explicit flow
control there's above described data packets are also governed by a
sliding window-like flow control. So no single channel is able to
completely saturate the link.

But for certain applications explicit flow control is necessary.

As both GLINK and SMD has these operations defined in the protocol
itself and the firmware is already written, I don't think we can come up
with something completely generic.

But I think these are good suggestions for how this functionality could
be implemented in the virtio backend.

Or one could borrow the design from GLINK and make use of the "reserved"
filed in struct rpmsg_hdr?
