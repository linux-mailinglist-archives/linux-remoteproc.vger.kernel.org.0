The protocol enacted between a remote processor and the host is very platform
dependent.  The need to wait for a reply in the IMX DSP driver predates my time
as maintainer of this subsystem and as such can't comment on the reasons it
was introduced.  That said I am very disappointed by the complete silence from
S.J and the rest of the people on the linux-imx mailing list regarding this
issue.

This has already been discussed.  Adapting the Linux kernel driver for all the
protocols that can be enacted by remote processors doesn't scale.  This is
something that needs to happen in the FW and Iuliana's approach in [1] is
appropriate.

I think the pushback is caused by a lack of understanding of the problem by the
maintainers.
