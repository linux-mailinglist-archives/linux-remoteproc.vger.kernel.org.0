Yeah, my focus right now is to get my NTB patch series upstreamed [A],
So I might not be able to get to this any sooner. As Mathieu suggested,
I recommend you to pick the generic parts of my series that doesn't
involve PCI or NTB or VHOST MMIO.

The following patches in my series should get the generic vhost
infrastructure part up.

0001-vhost-Make-_feature_-bits-a-property-of-vhost-device.patch
0002-vhost-Introduce-standard-Linux-driver-model-in-VHOST.patch
0003-vhost-Add-ops-for-the-VHOST-driver-to-configure-VHOS.patch

0006-vhost-Introduce-configfs-entry-for-configuring-VHOST.patch

0008-rpmsg-virtio_rpmsg_bus-Disable-receive-virtqueue-cal.patch
0009-rpmsg-Introduce-configfs-entry-for-configuring-rpmsg.patch
0010-rpmsg-virtio_rpmsg_bus-Add-Address-Service-Notificat.patch
0011-rpmsg-virtio_rpmsg_bus-Move-generic-rpmsg-structure-.patch

0014-rpmsg-Add-VHOST-based-remote-processor-messaging-bus.patch
0015-samples-rpmsg-Setup-delayed-work-to-send-message.patch
0016-samples-rpmsg-Wait-for-address-to-be-bound-to-rpdev-.patch
0017-rpmsg.txt-Add-Documentation-to-configure-rpmsg-using.patch

Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarifications.

Thank you for working on this.

Best Regards,
Kishon
