Diffstat looks great, 765 (+), 1164 (-), good to see all that duplicated code
factored away. But R5 is the largest of the 3 drivers and really needs it the
most.

Looking at the data structure in R5 preventing this I see what should be
the normal "struct k3_rproc" structure is really split into two,
"struct k3_r5_rproc"  and "struct k3_r5_core". The first containing a single
instance of the latter. There is no reason for this split I can see, just
combine the two structs.

Next, there are some members of the struct that we don't need, such as
atcm_enable and the others that are only used in probe (or functions
called as part of probe). We only use these as a way to collect this
info in one function, and use in a later one. Instead you could either
fetch this info at the time of use. Or move these members into the
cluster level "struct k3_r5_cluster".

Speaking of "struct k3_r5_cluster", it is silly for cluster to keep a list
of cores. There are two, and will only ever be two. No clue why a list was
chosen as the data structure to hold two pointers, switch this two an array
of size two, or even just two pointers. This also cleans up a bunch of the
weird "list_for_each" logic and loops that have to then check if they have
found with core0 or core1. Instead, just directly access core0 or core1.

That gets rid of member "struct list_head" from the combined struct,
and would you look at that, the struct now matches DSP/M4 :)

I'd suggest doing the above fixups to R5 first, then you can do
this series here after that and include R5.

Thanks,
Andrew
