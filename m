I think this should be #2.

This should be #1.  Once this is firmly in place #2 (above) should be relatively
easy to implement.  #1 and #2 can be in the same patchset, or not, depending on
what you prefer.

That should probably come after #1 and #2, and in a separate patchset.

Perfect, we are on the same page.
