Yes.

I couldn't find the code to do this, maybe you can give me some hint on this.

I see the function register the device to the bus, I wonder if this
means the device could be probed and used by the driver before
virtio_device_ready().

We don't want to allow the driver to unbreak a device since it's
easier to have bugs.

It tries to forbid the virtqueue callbacks to be called before
virtio_device_ready(). This helps to prevent the malicious device from
attacking the driver.

But unfortunately, it breaks several driver because:

1) some driver have races in probe/remove
2) it tries to reuse vq->broken which may break the driver that call
virqueue_add() before virtio_device_ready() which is allowed by the
spec

There's a discussion to have a better behavior that doesn't break the
existing drivers. And the IRQ hardening feature is marked as broken
now, so rpmsg should be fine without any extra effort.

Probably not, there's no guarantee that the device will not send
notification after virqtueue_disable_cb().
