So, there are two things w.r.t rpmsg device hierarchy - buffer
allocations and the overall hierarchy to allow a child rpmsg device to
be able to retrieve the corresponding rproc. This is done using
rproc_get_by_child() which walks up the dev parent hierarchy and
matching the parent device type to rproc_type.

Commit 086d08725d34 adds a new vdevbuffer device with parent as the
rproc platform device and makes this the parent of the virtio device, so
the buffer allocations were unchanged just with that commit, but the
rproc lookup will always fail. The later commit d999b622fcfb3 switches
the buffer allocation over to the vdevbuffer device, and with rproc
drivers that added dedicated vdevbuf pools allocates from those pools
(these were mostly coming from a specific rproc platform device memory
region index anyway). For those that did not define, this actually
became the global pool even if the rproc device was using a single
DMA/CMA pool (patch 1).

Please see my cover-letter for an example of the dev hierarchy.

I am not sure if you were interpreting this patch with or without
d999b622fcfb3 ("rpmsg: virtio: allocate buffer from parent"). Both of
the above commits are in 5.1, so I consider this patch to be fixing only
on 5.1+ kernels and it does use d999b622fcfb3. Buffer allocations after
this patch without d999b622fcfb3 would try to allocate from rproc device
which is a pseudo-device and doesn't have any pools defined with it, so
will allocate from the global pool.

Not sure what you are proposing here, since you cannot retrieve a rproc
handle. We use this to perform address translations in rpmsg drivers
since all the addresses are with the rproc device.

> The alternative could be to declare the rpmsg device in device tree as child of the rproc platform device...

And that is completely orthogonal and doesn't solve the current scenario
where rpmsg devices are created through the virtio-rpmsg bus nameservice
announcement.
