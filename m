Ok - I'll spin off another revision with this binding and a proper yaml file.

I understand where you are coming from.  The problem with an enumeration is that
it conflicts with rproc::recovery, which still has to be taken into account.

Platform drivers can access and set rproc::recovery so any specific case can be
handled there.  And with regards to sysfs, changing the setting requires root
access.  Someone with this kind of previleges should know what they are
doing - if they don't then they'll learn very quickly.

Have a good weekend,
