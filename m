I haven't been able to get any feedback from ModemManager, however
personally I'm more inclined to go with a global switch for the sake of
simplicity. At least until we have some idea of how to tie this together
in userpsace. This is the approach taken by IPA right now too.

If I understand correctly, this wakeup is always enabled on downstream,
and the RIL stack is expected to configure the modem to not send
spurious messages while the AP is in suspend.

Given that on phones the only time we don't want to wake up for
calls/sms is when on aeroplane mode (or some other explicit user
decision) I'm not sure that tying it to the socket is the best option,
at least initially.

I expect there to be some teething problems on the userspace side, and
some folks are going to want to disable this feature until those are
resolved. Making it a sysfs control means that we aren't reliant on
ModemManager to implement support for it.

Lastly (apologies this is getting a little long...), the sensor DSP also
utilises this mechanism to be able to wake the device on significant
motion. Similarly decoupling the wakeup control from whatever daemon is
responsible for handling this feels simpler to me, just poke sysfs and
the device will stop waking up when you move it.

=== Related bug ===

We've been shipping this patch in postmarketOS for a few months now, and
I've come across a very rare null pointer splat where channel->ept.rpdev
is null inside qcom_glink_rx_data(). I'm unsure if this is a bug in my
patch or in glink and I wondered if you have any idea.
