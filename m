The sequence above staring by "the actual sequence to load a remoteproc firmware

A simplified sequence showing the implementation after this commit would be

1) request_firmware()
2) rproc_load_fw() (optional)
3) rproc_parse_fw()
4) rproc_handle_resources()
5) rproc_load_segments() (optional)
6) rproc->ops->start()

Here we introduce rproc_load_fw() because we need to load the firmware and
authenticate it before parsing it for the resource table calling rproc_parse_fw().

legacy Elf format sequence:
1) request_firmware()
3) rproc_parse_fw()
4) rproc_handle_resources()
5) rproc_load_segments()
6) rproc->ops->start()


Requested remoteproc TEE sequence
1) request_firmware()
2) rproc_load_fw()
3) rproc_parse_fw()
4) rproc_handle_resources()
6) rproc->ops->start()

Right, the terminology can be confusing, but both perform a load. We arrived at
this terminology with Mathieu, but if you have a suggestion, don't hesitate to
share.

From a Linux perspective, it is only one firmware image to load.

The format defined in OP-TEE, available here [1], allows concatenation of
several firmware images into one signed binary image. For instance, for the
stm32mp2 platform, we can run a TF-M and a Zephyr firmware on the Cortex-M33.

Do you decrypt before authenticating? On the stm32mp1, due to memory
constraints, we encrypt only the ELF segment to load. We compute the signature
based on the encrypted version of the ELF. So, we authenticate before decrypting."

Sorry if it was not clear. By 'loading the firmware into Linux memory' I mean
calling request_firmware() to get the image from the filesystem and copy it into
Linux-allocated memory. Then, the address of this memory is registered in OP-TEE
memory space and provided as a parameter of the TA_RPROC_FW_CMD_LOAD_FW command.

Not only that, it is to ensure that everything is valid and decrypted before
enabling the parsing of the resource table (rproc_parse_fw()).

Make sense, but not possible with the resource table handling.

Yes this is the blocking point. I suppose that you don't have this constraint in
Qualcomm implementations?

My apologize with the succession of versions and associated discussions. I
forgot that a series version must be self-sufficient in terms of explanation.

Yes, the main difference is that for ELF files, we get the resource table from
the ELF image and put it in rproc->cached_table. Then, the cached_table is
updated in rproc_handle_resources() and finally written to the destination
memory in rproc_start().

For the TEE implementation, we directly provide the destination memory address,
which is stored in rproc->cached_table.

Notice that the rproc->cached_table is mandatory for the recovery.

The call of rproc_load_fw() should be moved in rproc_fw_boot(), I guess

What would you suggest as the next step for these commits? Should I just rename
load_fw to release_fw? If so, do you have a naming suggestion?

Or do we need to find another way to sequence the boot?

Thanks,
Arnaud
