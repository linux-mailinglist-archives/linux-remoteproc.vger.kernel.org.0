You are right allocation is not affected by your patch.
It is still done in the memory pool attached to rvdev.
This is the main point i missed. I reviewed the whole parent hierarchy to better understand why your patch
does not affect the memory allocation.
Now it clear to me, sorry for my misunderstanding of your point.

Yes it another discussion. The only thing i would like to highlight here (for future discussion) is the relation chip
you create between rpmsg and remoteproc using rproc_get_by_child. 
Would be nice to have an abstraction layer for memory allocation and translation for generic RPMsg devices decorrelated
from remoteproc.
No more the topic here...
