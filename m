Hi Arnaud,

Thank you for your response.

I created a section in the linker script for ZephyrOS that is reserved 
for the host. The kernel module parses the ELF file and creates the 
vrings and the buffers in it. There is no device tree on my x86 host, 
there is just BIOS and ACPI magic.

I forgot to mention this, the PA address (host) of the shared memory is 
written to a variable in the shared memory, so ZephyrOS/OpenAMP can 
translate back the buffer addresses to DA. But this is a hack I would 
really like to get rid of. This would be the reason for the dma_map_ops 
implementation, so the driver on the host has full control what 
addresses the vring writes into the descriptors.

Thanks, I will take a look at it.
