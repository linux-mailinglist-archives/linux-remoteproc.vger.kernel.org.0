Just to make sure it's clear, this is merely a suggestion based on my
experience, not a review request. But if the format of the structure
isn't already defined, I would suggest packing some additional
information in there.

Qualcomm has SMEM which is an allocate-only "heap" which is shared
between Linux and the different remoteprocs, so that's used to share
such information between the different systems.

It sounds correct to me that you don't want to introduce something like
that to solve this problem. In fact I think your solution is quite
elegant.

It sounds like a good idea to have a "type" or "version" here, to allow
changing the struct at a later point if necessary.

But you're probably only going to be using a few bits here, and iiuc you
only use 1 bit from the "crash_state". So you should be able to reduce
the size of these types.

Would that be sufficient to convey a good error message?

As an example I triggered an error on one of the Qualcomm remoteprocs
earlier today, the error message is 17 characters, but then it includes
the process, file and line number of the error and the caller. So in
total it's 73 characters - but it gave me a pretty good idea of what
went wrong.

>         uint32_t reserved;

Why pad here? If you want an even size, make the string 20 characters
(or adjust the u32 pair at the beginning). If you want room for future
improvements, use the "type" field for that.

Give it some extra thought, and weigh it against memory budget etc and
pick something that you think suits you.

I'd still suggest that you \0-terminate the string explicitly on the
Linux side, just to be safe. You don't want a firmware bug to crash your
Linux driver.
