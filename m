Why is this useful?

You mean, the chinfo driver_override allows the ioctl to specify which
driver should be bound to the device created for the newly registered
endpoint?

So today a rpmsg_device gets the same attributes both from the class and
the bus? So the only difference is that there will no longer be a
/sys/class/rpmsg ?
