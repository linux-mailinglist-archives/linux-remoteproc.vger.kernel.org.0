I am definitely not asking to ignore the auto-boot flag.  All I said is that I
did not split the semantic in rproc_boot() because of the auto-boot flag and the
mechanic to handle it.

I don't think there is a need to turn off auto-boot for early boot, rproc_boot()
will to the right thing.

As for the way forward, the easiest way I see is to call either rproc_shutdown()
or rproc_detach() based on rproc->state in rproc_del().  That will work with
devm_rproc_remove() and it is still possible for platorm drivers to explicitly
call rproc_shutdown() before rproc_del() to force a remote processor that was
attached to be switched off when the driver is removed.

That is all the time I had for remoteproc - I am officially away for the next two weeks.
