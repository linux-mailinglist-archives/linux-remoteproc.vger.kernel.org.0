Yup, a way to describe boot-time memory regions in IORT is in the 
process of being specced out; the first attempt at an equivalent for DT 
is here:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-iommu/20191209150748.2471814-1-thierry.reding@gmail.com/

If that's not enough and the SMMU still needs to treat certain Stream 
IDs specially because they may be untranslatable (due to having direct 
access to memory as a side-channel), then that should be handled in the 
SoC-specific corner of the SMMU driver, not delegated to individual 
endpoint drivers.
