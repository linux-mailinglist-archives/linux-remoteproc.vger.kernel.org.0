I have two concerns with migrating things to a character device:

1) Operating an ioctl based interface requires specialized tooling. E.g.
today whatever your installation is you can change firmware name and
start a core with the user space tools you have. Further more allowing
you to change firmware name before powering on the core would imply that
both of these would have to be ioctls (we can't just boot the core on
open) - so we would end up duplicating all parts of the sysfs interface
in ioctls.

2) Reducing the functionality of the sysfs interface would break
compatibility with existing user space, which is verboten. So we would
at best duplicate the existing features.


That said, per the same argument I don't really like duplicating the
state controls in a character device (i.e. Rishabh's patch), but this
really does provide something that we can't do with the current
interface.
