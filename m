Regarding __qcom_smd_send function. if message length is higher than 
fifo_size EINVAL error is returned, else if send failed EAGAIN error is 
returned ( meaning that it is busy and that client has to retry to sent 
it later).
Based on this behavior, seems make sense to return channel->fifo_size
as MTU value.

Yes this is the flow control that could have to be in core or splitted 
between the core and the platform driver. We had a first discussion with 
Bjorn few month ago on this subject, the need was identified.

So no simple way for GLINK :(, anyway thanks for you time and your 
expertise.

An alternative could be a DT property that could be defined depending on 
the remote side constraint.

Bjorn,
please, could you share your view to help to find a solution to 
implement the MTU for Glink? or should we simply consider the MTU ops as 
optional and in this case how to determine a default size?

Thanks,
Arnaud
