Thanks, so if I understand correctly, there could be a race between
the virtio_device_ready() and the name service:

If the announcement came before DRIVER_OK, it might be dropped by the device.

Michael proposed to allow the callback after vq kick, I think the
rpmsg callback is ready before it kicks the device. If this is true,
no more updates.

But to be safe, I will cc you and all the other maintainers for the
patch of the above proposal.
