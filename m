I assumed the decision to make separate schemas rather than a big one
was already made, since Sibi's series was applied and has already moved
parts of qcom,q6v5.txt into separate schemas.

Still, I did coordinate with Sireesh before submitting this patch and
suggested that he can likely just add the new "qcom,msm8953-mss-pil"
compatible from his series to the DT schema in this patch (the setup is
also very similar).

Which properties would you move to a common schema? Most of the schema
is just listing items for generic properties (interrupts, clocks, power
domains, supplies, resets, memory-region, ...) and having them separated
is intended to avoid lots of if statements in a common schema.

What remains is maybe:

  - "qcom,smem-states", which is already used in several other schemas
    and could be possibly defined together with #qcom,smem-state-cells
    in some generic schema(?)

  - "qcom,halt-regs", "firmware-name", "smd-edge" are used by different
    Qualcomm remoteproc drivers, so they could possibly be defined in
    some common "qcom-remoteproc.yaml" schema(?)

Thanks,
Stephan
