Ok this similar to what we proposed and has been mentioned by Oleksij:
"remoteproc: add system resource manager device" patch set
So this is handled by a client on top of rpmsg, no impact on the rpmsg 
vrings initialization and management.

The resource table mainly contains definitions related to the shared 
memories, no HW Peripheral (but could be used in future for this kind of 
declaration should be possible soon; https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/6/29/187).
Resource table is not mandatory, but it is the generic way to define 
rpmsg memories and probe the rpmsg bus driver. Here is an exemple of 
resource table:
https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/open-amp/pull/2/files#diff-65def9751b4fbc10973e184b5daa80e9
