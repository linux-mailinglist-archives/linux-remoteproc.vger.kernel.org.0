The patch [4/4] define the a read only attribute using the rpmsg_show_attr
declaration[1]. So the userspace can't change it.

This also has the advantage of not allowing the new IOCTRL API to be used by
default for legacy RPMSg devices without a specific patch.

That's make sense. If we go on this way we could also trust the root application
for the rpmsg_ns and only protect the rpmsg_ctrl which can not release itself,
as you proposed.
