Yeah I was talking about the single-core ones, not the multicore ones, my bad for

I'm not convinced yet. We'd be sparing just two lines of code (or 3?), which is
not a big deal really...

If we do that, then yes that would be 100% needed to retain backwards compatibility
with the old devicetrees, unless we add even more code to this driver to check if
the firmware exists and, if not, check if the old name exists and, if not, fail.

Also, why should we make the linux-firmware maintainer get mad? :-)

The logic here is to get this optimized by the compiler: "mediatek," is a constant
and the result of strlen is predefined (same for the other occurrence in the string
length plausibility check up there).

On the other hand, finding the pointer with strchr() means iterating.

I thought about that, and tried it too: comes out with more lines of code than what
you see here, and also gets trickier to read... especially when wanting to support
"scp.img" and "scp_c0.img".

Unless you mean to change the path to "mediatek/(soc_name)/rest-of-compatible.img"
as in "mediatek/mt8188/scp-dual-c0.img" (because we still have to append a core
number text as the core 0 firmware cannot be loaded on core 1 and vice-versa), but
even then.... honestly, I'm not sure how objectively better could that be compared
to just hardcoding "scp" and "scp_c(core-number)"... just because either one or the
other solution still implies doing similar checks (which might be more expensive?
didn't write a poc for this idea, so not sure about that).

I don't have very strong opinions on that, and seeing one function call or two is
not making me happy, nor sad. I did what you proposed in other occasions (and not
in remoteproc) but then got suggestion to do otherwise, and that's the main reason
why you see the code laid out like that and the reasoning I wrote.

Finally, I'm open for whichever of the two solutions - it probably just boils
down to maintainers' preference, in which case...

Mathieu or Bjorn: what do you prefer seeing here?
