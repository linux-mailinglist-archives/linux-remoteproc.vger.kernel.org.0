I understand, Mathieu and I have kept in mind this compatibility. I think we
maintain the legacy. But yes, agree with you that a non regression test using
the Qcom drivers is important to ensure that.

This split is coming during review discussions with Mathieu, to ease the
reviews. So versions depend on series reviews iteration.
But it is not necessary to get them in one package "just" to respect dependencies.

Here is the order you have to respect:

1) [PATCH v5 0/4] Restructure the rpmsg char to decorrelate the control part
=> first patch that impact rpmsg_char client drivers.
minor impact but right, not tested on Qcom platform (only build testd for Qcom
drivers)

2) [PATCH v4 0/4] rpmsg: char: introduce the rpmsg-raw channel
As described in the cover letter to be applied on top of:
[PATCH v5 0/4] Restructure the rpmsg char to decorrelate the control part
=> tested by  Julien Massot from iot.bzh

3) [PATCH v3] rpmsg: ctrl: Introduce new RPMSG_CREATE/RELEASE_DEV_IOCTL controls
To apply on top of the two previous ones.

So either you can integrate and test them one by one, or i can squash them in a
new series if this can simplify your integration.

In any cases, just send me an email if you need patch-sets refactoring, or
clarification on some points.

Correct independent patch, thanks for the patch update.
