The commit message that enters the git history should explain why the

Then please update the two flows in the commit message to clearly
describe what the race is. All I see is the logical/sequential error,
which should be resolved.

We might have a race condition as well? If so it needs to be clearly
described.

The logical issue is straightforward to reason about, can't we start
with solving that? Then you can describe your race condition without
conflating it with the logical error.
