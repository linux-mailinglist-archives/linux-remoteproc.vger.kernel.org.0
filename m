You're right and this would certainly not help the confusion.

How about we introduce a new state named DETACHED and make the platform
drivers specify that the remote processor is in either OFFLINE (as
today) or DETACHED during initialization.

Then on_init = true would be the action of going from DETACHED to
RUNNING, which would involve the following actions:

1) find resource table
2) prepare device (?)
3) handle resources
4) allocate carveouts (?)
5) prepare subdevices
6) "attach"
7) start subdevices

on_init = false would represent the transition from OFFLINE to RUNNING,
which today involve the following actions:

1) request firmware
2) prepare device
3) parse fw
4) handle resources
5) allocate carveouts
6) load segments
7) find resource table
8) prepare subdevices
9) "boot"
10) start subdevices

Understood.

This would be the { on_init = true, after_stop = false } use case, with
the new state would relate to the journey of DETACHED -> RUNNING ->
OFFLINE.

As such the next boot would represent above OFFLINE -> RUNNING case,
which we already support today.

I've not been able to come up with a reasonable use case for the {
on_init = ture, after_stop = true } scenario.

But Wendy previously talked about the need to "detach" Linux from a
running remote processor, by somehow just letting it know that the
communication is down - to allow Linux to be rebooted while the remote
was running. So if we support a transition from RUNNING to DETACHED
using a sequence of something like:

1) stop subdevices
2) "detach"
3) unprepare subdevices
4) release carveouts (?)
5) unprepare device (?)

Then perhaps the after_stop could naturally be the transition from
DETACHED to RUNNING, either with or without a reboot of the system
in between?

Just to make sure we're on the same page:

after_crash = false is what we have today, and would mean:

1) stop subdevices
2) power off
3) unprepare subdevices
4) generate coredump
5) request firmware
6) load segments
7) find resource table
8) prepare subdevices
9) "boot"
10) start subdevices

after_crash = true would mean:

1) stop subdevices
2) "detach"
3) unprepare subdevices
4) prepare subdevices
5) "attach"
6) start subdevices

State diagram wise both of these would represent the transition RUNNING
-> CRASHED -> RUNNING, but somehow the platform driver needs to be able
to specify which of these sequences to perform. Per your naming
suggestion above, this does sound like a "autonomous_recovery" boolean
to me.

Right, that was clear from your patches. Sorry that my reply didn't
convey the information that I had understood this.

I think I see what you mean, as we use "start" for both syncing and
starting the core, a { on_init = true, after_stop = false } setup either
needs two tables or force conditionals on the platform driver.

How about adding a new ops named "attach" to rproc_ops, which the
platform driver can specify if it supports attaching an already running
processor?

I still think keeping things in the core is the right thing to do.


Please let me know what you think!

PS. If we agree on this the three transitions becomes somewhat
independent, so I think it makes sense to first land support for the
DETACHED -> RUNNING transition (and the stm32 series), then follow up
with RUNNING -> DETACHED and autonomous recovery separately.
