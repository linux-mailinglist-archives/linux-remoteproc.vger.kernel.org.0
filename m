I'm not sure to understand what is behind your question.
I guess the question is why is it useful to create a channel?
Mainly to use same way to probe a RPMsg service than the NS announcement.

Yes exactly, this is the main point of the proposal. Having the same RPMsg
driver that can be probed either by the remote side using the NS announcement
mechanism or by the rpmsg ctrl interface.
The driver "just" has to register to the RPMsg ctrl which service it supports.

Yes, if the rpmsg_char is probed by the bus,
My proposal is to suppress attributes in /sys/class/rpmsg as they are already
defined in /sys/bus/rpmsg/devices/
But class attribute can be kept if needed...

Thanks,
Arnaud
