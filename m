The difference between the two is that sysmon ensures that it won't send
any messages to the stopping remoteproc.

The design is such that subdev notifications are not allowed to
communicate with the dying remoteproc when crashed=true.

This means that any listeners to these notifications needs to ensure
they play nice with regards to the dying remoteproc, which includes
sending messages to it or waiting for any new or pending incoming
notifications - QMI or otherwise.

As such I think it makes sense to consider qmi_handle_release() to be an
operation that will send messages and should not be performed in the
notification handler.

I think you're right, for the operations we describe today there
shouldn't be any dependencies between the layers for prepare and
unprepare.
