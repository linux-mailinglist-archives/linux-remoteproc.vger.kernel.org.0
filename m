Seems to me that this patch is useless
- wait_event_interruptible_timeout() function already seems
to test the condition (so call get_a_tx_buf()) before entering in sleep[1].
- ftraces show that vq interrupt is not called during the 15-second period.
  So it is a normal behavior that the vrp->sendq is never waked-up.

Tim needs to analyze the reason why no mailbox interrupt occurs.
