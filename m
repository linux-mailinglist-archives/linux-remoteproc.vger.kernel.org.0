Before moving forward on rpmsg_tty i would prefer that we are aligned with Bjorn
on the implementation of the rpmsg_tty itself and the evolution of the service name...
Then rpmsg_tty could be a good threadfor a first implementation...


Concerning the name service, having a discussion around the name service skeleton would
be nice. This could be an good input for the helpers function definition.

Propositions in rpmsg_tty thread are

<service_name>-<feature>
or
<service_name>-<feature>-<sub_service>

don't hesitate to comment and/or propose alternatives

Arnaud
