For your usecases, you would definitely need the syscon/regmap behavior
to be shared right. Whether we introduce a 'shared' API or an
'exclusive' API and change the current API behavior to shared, it is
definitely a case-by-case usage scenario for the existing drivers and
usage right. The main contention point is what to do with the
unprotected usecases like Bjorn originally pointed out.
