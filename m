Please have a look at this lore link [1]. The idea is to add syscon
and regmap support which I did in the v2 patchset.

I just wanted to show why we are using syscon based on the arguments

Here I would like to explain the current suggestion and suggest an alternative solution.

1/ For more clarity, here is a complete example of use of both remote cores
at the same time:

    syscon@1a010000 {
        compatible = "arm,sse710-host-base-sysctrl", "simple-mfd", "syscon";
        reg = <0x1a010000 0x1000>;

        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <1>;

        remoteproc@310 {
            compatible = "arm,sse710-extsys0";
            reg = <0x310 8>;
            firmware-name = "es0_flashfw.elf";
            mboxes = <&mhu0_hes0 0 1>, <&mhu0_es0h 0 1>;
            mbox-names = "txes0", "rxes0";
            memory-region = <&extsys0_vring0>, <&extsys0_vring1>;
        };

        remoteproc@318 {
            compatible = "arm,sse710-extsys1";
            reg = <0x318 8>;
            firmware-name = "es1_flashfw.elf";
            mboxes = <&mhu0_hes1 0 1>, <&mhu0_es1h 0 1>;
            mbox-names = "txes0", "rxes0";
            memory-region = <&extsys1_vring0>, <&extsys1_vring1>;
        };
};

Here we have 2 cores, each one have 2 registers mapped respectively
at 0x1a010310 and 0x1a010318.

Definetly these cores have seperate HW resources associated with them
which are the MHUs (mailboxes HW). There are 2 pairs of MHUs associated
with each core. These mailbox peripherals are obviously seperate.
Furthermore, the vring buffers used for communication are seperate.

Moreover, the remote cores are independent. They are not SMP cores of one processor.

They can have different default firmware to use. In this example es0_flashfw.elf
and es1_flashfw.elf

The current HW implementation (Corstone-1000) provides one remote core only.
However, the second core control registers are at 0x1a010318 do exist.

Support for a second core is taken into consideration in this work to help
end users who want to add a second core to their HW.

2/ Here I'm suggesting an alternative solution by using one remoteproc node for both cores as
follows:

    syscon@1a010000 {
        compatible = "arm,sse710-host-base-sysctrl", "simple-mfd", "syscon";
        reg = <0x1a010000 0x1000>;

        remoteproc {
            compatible = "arm,sse710-extsys";
            firmware-name = "es0_flashfw.elf";
            mboxes = <&mhu0_hes0 0 1>, <&mhu0_es0h 0 1>, <&mhu0_hes1 0 1>, <&mhu0_es1h 0 1>;
            mbox-names = "txes0", "rxes0", "txes1", "rxes1";
            memory-region = <&extsys0_vring0>, <&extsys0_vring1>, <&extsys1_vring0>, <&extsys1_vring1>;
        };
};

Does this meet your expectations please ?

The firmware of the second core depends on the end user choice.
Currently the second core is not implemented in the HW.
Users who want to tweak Corstone-1000 HW can add
a second core.

Kind regards
