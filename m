Thank you for your feedback. I am not very familiar with PCIe, so I need 
to take a deeper look at the implementation.

To help me better understand your expectations, could you please confirm 
if your proposal is close to what I have described below?


1) Device tree:
Notice that an intermediate ahb bus is used on ST platform for address 
conversion between remote processor address and local physical address
I will probably need to find a solution for that.


firmware {
    remoteproc_tee {
	compatible = "remoteproc-tee";
	mlahb: ahb {
	    compatible = "st,mlahb", "simple-bus";
	    #address-cells = <1>;
	    #size-cells = <1>;
	    ranges;
	    dma-ranges = <>;
	    m33_rproc@0 {
       		compatible = "st,stm32mp1-m33";
      		/* M33 watchdog interrupt */
      		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 4 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		/* power domain management */
		power-domains = <&cluster_pd>, <&ret_pd>;
		power-domain-names = "default", "sleep";
		/* RPMsg mailboxes + M33 graceful shutdown request */
		mboxes = <&ipcc1 0x0>, <&ipcc1 0x1>, <&ipcc1 2>;
		mbox-names = "vq0", "vq1", "shutdown";
		memory-region = <&vdev0vring0>, <&vdev0vring1>,
				<&vdev0buffer>;
		status = "okay";
	    };
         };

	ahbsr: ahb@2 {
	   compatible = "st,mlahb", "simple-bus";
	   #address-cells = <1>;
	   #size-cells = <1>;
	   ranges = <>;
	   dma-ranges = <>;
	   m0_rproc@1 {
       		compatible = "st,stm32mp1-m0";
		mboxes = <&ipcc2 2>;
		mbox-names = "shutdown";
		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 7 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		/* M0 peripheral clocking (not accessible by the M0) */
		clocks = <>, <>;
     		status = "okay";
	   };
        };
     };
};

2) remoteproc_driver:
   - platform driver that registers a TEE driver with specified UUID
   - on TEE driver probing it parses sub device (reg property replacing
     st, proc_id property)
   - tries to open associated TEE session and in case of success
     probes associated rproc driver.

3) st,remoteproc drivers
   -  unique DT compatible, no secure-status use (legacy compatibility)
   -  need to add a mechanism to detect probing
      by the TEE bus, or directly probed by the ahb bus.


Thanks,
Arnaud
