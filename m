Any comments on this? This discussion is what's holding up this series from
getting merged.

Also, FWIW, I spent a bit of time looking at the R5s (called RPU) in the Xilinx
ZynqMP, and the integration aspects are very different between the TI and Xilinx
SoCs, so I do not think even a single binding is possible between the two SoCs.
A few of them to cite:

1. TI SoCs require the power/resets to be released for both the Cores in
LockStep-mode, while it was enough to just release the Core0 resets on ZynqMP.
So, our binding requires that both CPUs be defined for sure as the reset
controls are defined per core, while you don't see them on the RPU.

2. There are specific core reset sequences on TI SoCs in LockStep and
Split-modes on TI SoCs, I am not sure if there are any with Xilinx SoCs.

3. The TCMs are embedded within the R5F sub-system on TI SoCs, and are
controlled by the same power and clock as the R5Fs. There is an additional CPU
halt line that controls the core execution, and allows us to enable the access
to these. The ZynqMP looks to have completely independent control to the TCMs.
This is the reason why they are represented as individual mmio-sram nodes in the
Xilinx binding.

4. The TCMs and which one appears at the R5 address 0 are programmable on TI
SoCs, I couldn't tell if this is the case with Xilinx SoCs.

Ben and Stefano,
Please do clarify, if I am off on any of the above differences.

Suman
