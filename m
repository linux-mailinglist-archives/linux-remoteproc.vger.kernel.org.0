Another important service is SCMI, which drivers use to manage clocks 
and resets.
These clocks and resets are declared in the Device Tree (DT). It seems 
to me that
in this case, we are closer to SCMI than to the RNG service.

I propose we discuss this based on a concrete example with the STM32MP25.
Although not yet upstreamed, our plan is to manage signed firmware for the
Cortex-M33 and Cortex-M0.

Please find below my view of the DT resources to address.

STM32MP25  Cortex-M33 and Cortex-M0 nodes:

m33_rproc {
   /* M33 watchdog interrupt */
   interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
   interrupts = <GIC_SPI 4 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
   /* power domain management */
   power-domains = <&cluster_pd>, <&ret_pd>;
   power-domain-names = "default", "sleep";
   /* RPMsg mailboxes + M33 graceful shutdown request */
   mboxes = <&ipcc1 0x0>, <&ipcc1 0x1>, <&ipcc1 2>;
   mbox-names = "vq0", "vq1", "shutdown";
   memory-region = <&vdev0vring0>, <&vdev0vring1>, <&vdev0buffer>;
   status = "okay";
};

m0_rproc {
   /* mailbox for graceful shutdown */
   mboxes = <&ipcc2 2>;
   mbox-names = "shutdown";
   /* M0 watchdog */
  interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
  interrupts = <GIC_SPI 7 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
  /* M0 peripheral clocking (not accessible by the M0) */
  clocks = <&scmi_clk CK_SCMI_GPIOZ_AM>,
  <&scmi_clk CK_SCMI_GPIOZ>,
  <&scmi_clk CK_SCMI_IPCC2>,
  <&scmi_clk CK_SCMI_IPCC2_AM>,
  <&rcc CK_LPTIM3_AM>,
  <&rcc CK_LPUART1_AM>,
  <&rcc CK_CPU3_AM>,
  <&rcc CK_CPU3>,
  <&rcc CK_LPUART1_C3>,
  <&rcc CK_GPIOZ_C3>,
  <&rcc CK_LPTIM3_C3>,
  <&rcc CK_KER_LPUART1>,
  <&rcc CK_KER_LPTIM3>,
  <&scmi_clk CK_SCMI_GPIOZ>,
  <&scmi_clk CK_SCMI_IPCC2>;
  status = "okay";
};

If we want to remove the DT, we need to consider:

- Mechanism to differentiate Cortex-M33 and Cortex-M0:
   Similar to SCMI, the remoteproc OP-TEE service should support
  multiprocessor setups without instantiating multiple services.

- Mailboxes:

   A phandle is needed because the mailbox driver is managed by the
   Linux mailbox driver. STM32MP2 has two mailboxes.
   Moving towards your proposal would imply creating a mailbox service
   in TEE to manage non-secure mailboxes for non-secure IPC. This might
   not be efficient for inter-processor communication. Hardware-wise, it
   would require the IRQ to be handled by the secure context.

- Memory regions:
  - Hardware limitation: OP-TEE is limited in the number of memory regions
    it can declare due to Firewall configuration. Moving IPC memory regions
    reaches this limit. Currently, OP-TEE defines a single region with 
shareable
    access rights, which Linux splits into at least three memory regions 
for RPMsg.
  - Memory mapping: Memory regions still need to be declared in Linux to 
prevent
    Linux from using them.
  - Virtio/RPMsg: Memory region names are fixed (e.g., dev<X>vring<Y>), 
so OP-TEE
   must declare memory regions in its DT according to Linux naming 
conventions.

- Clock and reset:
    Some clocks and resets are managed via SCMI, others are not. This 
would require
   managing all clocks and resets through SCMI, with possible side 
effect on the
   "unused" clock mechanism in Linux ( to be confirmed)

- Power domain:
   Information is needed at the Linux level to determine the low power mode.

- Watchdog interrupt:
   Should be managed by OP-TEE, which requires the hardware to have an 
associated
   secure IRQ.

- Miscellaneous vendor DT properties:
    How to be sure that these can be addressed through TEE services?

Regarding the existing DT needs, it seems to me that removing the DT 
would require
moving all node resource management into TEE ( if really possible). This 
would
increase TEE complexity and footprint, reduce system efficiency, and 
make supporting
other platforms less scalable.

That said, it probably also depends on the TEE implementation.
And  we should support both. This could be done by introducing a second 
UUID.
but in this case should it be the same driver?

Yes the Linux passes the proc ID as argument of the 
tee_client_open_session().
In OP-TEE, the TEE service checks the match with the proc ID registered 
by the
OP-TEE remote proc drivers.
