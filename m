See https://lore.kernel.org/all/1631794913.472895.1119414.nullmailer@robh.at.kernel.org/

The rproc binding should have nothing to do with j721e SoC node
description. it should describe the rproc node that is described in
binding.

This is blocking any updates we would want to do in k3.yaml.

See above link. This is not to do with eaik / sk. I am trying to
standardize the board definitions in yaml for k3 and this binding
specifically is getting in the way.


I still don't understand what your contention is here. Are you arguing
that the binding example is correct and should be tied to a platform?


Yes, I know I can introduce oneOf and a little more intricate solution,
	but besides that, i disagree that a rproc binding should even
	have SoC specific top level node description in it.
a) rproc.yaml does'nt even describe the SoC. soc.yaml does.
b) The node property examples are supposed to be examples not tied to a
   specific SoC.

It is a common usage model. NOTE: these are example nodes and NOT meant
as SoC representation. I dont see the confusion.
