Those "few dozen cycles", is tasked with sending messages to RPMh for
voting and unvoting the buses, then tzmem will hopefully hit the
genpool, twice, and then radix updates, and then more genpool updated
and more radix tree work. And then of course there's the one context
switch to secure world.

If we don't have space in the genpool, we're going to grow
dma_alloc_coherent, extend the genpool, call secure world to register
the new tzmem. And then for all those cases where the allocation wasn't
enough, the retry (with updated size) will not fit in the
PAGE_ALIGN(size) genpool that was created, so we'll do this twice.

Fortunately the tzmem growing should only happen on first remoteproc
boot, but I think it's a bit optimistic to say "a few dozen"...


The drawback with making it 16KB is that we're not going to test that
error path very often. But the more idiomatic form of first calling with
a size of 0, then allocate and pass the proper size, seems a bit
wasteful to me as well - in particular if we do it anew each subsystem
boot.

PS. 16KB is 0.03% of the ADSP carveout (or 3% of the ADSP DeviceTree
carveout...).
