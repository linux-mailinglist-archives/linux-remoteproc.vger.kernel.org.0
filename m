The Host Base System Control [3] is the big block containing various functionalities (MMIO registers).
Among the functionalities, the two remote cores registers (aka External system 0 and 1).
The remote cores have two registers each.

1/ In the v1 patchset, a valid point was made by the community:

   Right now it seems somewhat tenuous to describe two consecutive
   32-bit registers as separate "reg" entries, but *maybe* it's OK if that's
   all there ever is. However if it's actually going to end up needing several
   more additional MMIO and/or memory regions for other functionality, then
   describing each register and location individually is liable to get
   unmanageable really fast, and a higher-level functional grouping (e.g. these
   reset-related registers together as a single 8-byte region) would likely be
   a better design.

   The Exernal system registers are part of a bigger block with other functionality in place.
   MFD/syscon might be better way to use these registers. You never know in
   future you might want to use another set of 2-4 registers with a different
   functionality in another driver.

   I would see if it makes sense to put together a single binding for
   this "Host Base System Control" register (not sure what exactly that means).
   Use MFD/regmap you access parts of this block. The remoteproc driver can
   then be semi-generic (meaning applicable to group of similar platforms)
   based on the platform compatible and use this regmap to provide the
   functionality needed.

2/ There are many examples in the kernel that use syscon as a parent node of
   child nodes for devices located at an offset from the syscon base address.
   Please see these two examples [1][2]. I'm trying to follow a similar design if that
   makes sense.

3/ Since there are two registers for each remote core. I'm suggesting to set the
   size in the reg property to 8. The driver will read the match data to get the right
   offset to be used with regmap APIs.

Suggested nodes:


    syscon@1a010000 {
        compatible = "arm,sse710-host-base-sysctrl", "simple-mfd", "syscon";
        reg = <0x1a010000 0x1000>;

        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <1>;

        remoteproc@310 {
            compatible = "arm,sse710-extsys0";
            reg = <0x310 8>;
            firmware-name = "es_flashfw.elf";
            mboxes = <&mhu0_hes0 0 1>, <&mhu0_es0h 0 1>;
            mbox-names = "txes0", "rxes0";
            memory-region = <&extsys0_vring0>, <&extsys0_vring1>;
        };

        remoteproc@318 {
            compatible = "arm,sse710-extsys1";
            reg = <0x318 8>;
            firmware-name = "es_flashfw.elf";
            mboxes = <&mhu0_hes1 0 1>, <&mhu0_es1h 0 1>;
            mbox-names = "txes0", "rxes0";
            memory-region = <&extsys1_vring0>, <&extsys1_vring1>;
        };
};
