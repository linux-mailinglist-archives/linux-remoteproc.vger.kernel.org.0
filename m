First of all, thank you for reviewing this and your response.

The cluster mode is a common theme, and if you have a preference for a common
property-name, both I and Ben can use that. The values though might vary between
different vendor SoCs.

I have given out all the differences and reasons on a v2 thread, the SoC and
clock and reset integration aspects make it look very different.
Please see the discussion here,
https://patchwork.kernel.org/comment/23560321/

There was only one open comment/question I had regarding Core identification
w.r.t my binding. Do you prefer a node-name index difference or a separate
core-id/cpu-id property identifying which is Core0 and Core1.

Yeah agreed. But the current architecture in System DT does allow you to add
plugins to generate the proper compliant dts node.

In anycase, I doubt TI will ever be using it in general, because we do not have
a concept of DT on our firmwares. I have given all these inputs again on v2, but
haven't seen any responses on it. So, I do appreciate your feedback.

Any specific reasons? For the most part, I am using all standard properties.
