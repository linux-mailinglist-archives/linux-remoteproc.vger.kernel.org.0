That would be the equivalent of 2 additional virtqueues in virtio RPmsg backend
- two virtqueues for the stream,
- two virtqueues for the control
Right?

yes this feature is something that would improve the rpmsg protocol.this could
also be interesting to pause some services on suspend.
If I well remember we also spoke about QOS, with possibility to define allocated
bandwidth per service.

In proposed implementation the signaling is managed in RPMsg backend. This means
that the backend has to be aware about the signaling defined in a service. In
some other term the signaling is fixed by the backend, and this patchset would
fix the signaling for all the backend, right?
In this case shouldn't it be part of the rpmsg core?

Then to be able to transfer signaling to the remote processor based on RPMsg
protocol
I suppose that the signaling has to be encapsulated in a RPMsg sent by an
endpoint to a remote endpoint.

How to do you keep compatibility with the legacy (no flow control)?

What about associating a control endpoint with a channel?
A channel could contain:
- a default data ept (the exiting one)
- a default control endpoint (the new one).

We could extend the ns announcement mechanism to notify the control endpoint to
a remote processor...

Arnaud
