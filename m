I do it. in rproc_boot_recovery()
- we call on rproc_stop()
    rproc_reset_rsc_table_on_stop() copy the resource table in
    rproc->cached_table
- we call rproc_load_fw()  added in patch 3/8
- we call rproc_start() which overwrite the resource table with values in
  proc->cached_table
	

The proc->cached_table avoid to release and reallocate all the carveout on recovery.
This management is one of the points that complexity the sequence in the
remoteproc_tee case.
