That would be a better approach than the current proposal.

Typically, the device tree is expected to describe the hardware to the
kernel rather than telling it what the hardware should look like. More
below.

But considering the dependency between split/lockstep mode and available
memory sizes as described here it maybe OK to have the firmware (via DT)
specify the configured mode. Though IMO it is overloading the device
tree functionality (not the first time) because that's the hammer we've
got.

Even in this scenario, ideally it would be the boot firmware's
responsibility to configure the RPU in the desired mode and communicate
the mode to the kernel. The driver can use the mode information to
verify that the system is in the expected state during probe and error
out if not.

Though taking this approach will not help the "testing" usecase
mentioned by Wendy.

IIUC, if the second R5 is not registered with remoteproc, it is not
possible to request loading firmware to it from userspace. So no special
case guards should be needed.
