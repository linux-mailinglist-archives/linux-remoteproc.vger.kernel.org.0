big data is always interesting, and you probably need some more tooling
around it than just the DMA pool in rproc especially if you were to
share it with other kernel subsystems. You would want to keep that
separate from the firmware regions. Our solution has been to use the
in-kernel buffer allocators/dma-buf exporters. We had our own
out-of-tree solution before, and now converging on to use the recently
added dma-buf heaps (drivers/dma-buf/heaps). You would want to know the
pool especially on non-MMU rprocs given that you would have to configure
certain Cache settings for the regions.

I am fine with going back to v1 (and ok with either of the versions :)).
I can post a v3 going back if we all agree that is what we want to merge.

Bjorn,
Your thoughts on this patch, and what's your preference?

The improvements can be follow-up patches. The first thing we should get
to is to get rid of the dma_declare_coherent_memory() before anything
else. We do not want any users of rproc_of_resm_mem_entry_init() to
exercise that path.

Yep, that was the idea. It would have fixed the existing drivers, and if
one wanted to customize, the platform drivers can choose the right id.
The name + id registration would also entail the platform drivers
knowing the id anyways. And today, the only other device where we are
registering a DMA pool is the vdev subdevice.
