Right, there's a tee_client_driver and there's a remoteproc driver.
Let's document clearly how these interact.

So, some separate device-memory, or some preallocated carveout which is
only accessible from secure world?

Does the OS need to retain @memref past this point?

Generic might be okay, but I'd prefer this to be less vague.

Also worth noting is the Qualcomm implementation of TZ-backed
remoteproc, which is already in the tree. There the firmware is loaded
into carveouts, the certificates and hashes are validated. Lastly
the operation "authenticate and start" is invoked, which does that, and
locks the OS out of the given memory region - until "shutdown" is
invoked.

Okay. But I would prefer that we define the semantics before it's
implemented...

We can't have an ABI which isn't well defined in intent. Your examples
would easily fall in the realm of a well defined interface, but this
ties into the question above - what does is actually mean in terms of
the memory carveouts and such.

This describes the state LOAD_FW leaves things in and the action you
expect the caller to take. Right now I need to read all the
documentation in order to understand how LOAD_FW works.

Document this behavior in relation to LOAD_FW.

I'm referring to
https://docs.kernel.org/doc-guide/kernel-doc.html#function-documentation,
i.e. a /** func() ... */ comment above each such function.

This allow the caller to easily reach the documentation by using
mechanism such as "jump-to-definition" in their IDE.

No, both of these examples has a '#' between '%' and 'x', which will
make the number be prefixed with 0x - making the base clear to the
reader.

What I mean is that here you're telling the user that there was an
error, with one value of "ret". Then you continue below, will find ret
with -EIO and then you will print another message saying that it failed
and this time with -EIO.

Why two prints?
