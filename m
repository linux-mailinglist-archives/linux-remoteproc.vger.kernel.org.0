Ok, thanks for clarifying. In other words: The IOMMU SIDs you have
specified in the overlay so far are sufficient for the current firmware
use cases to run successfully on Lemans?

It is sort of similar, except in this case Linux doesn't really do
anything itself with the mappings. In the video case, Linux dynamically
maps buffers (or similar) into those address spaces, while in the
remoteproc case those are fixed(?) for a specific firmware binary. At
least if I understood the explanations in your talk correctly.

Anyway, if you don't have these use cases for Lemans this can be
discussed later in the context of a specific example. I thought you have
this requirement for all platforms.

Thanks,
Stephan
