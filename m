In rpmsg_virtio_bus.c [1] the vdev buffers are allocated in a memory region using a dma_alloc_coherent
So the buffers are allocated in the platform driver memory region if declared, else in the default memory region. 

According to  086d08725d34 ("remoteproc: create vdev subdevice with specific dma memory pool"),
A patch has been integrated in rpmsg framework:  d999b622fcfb3 ("rpmsg: virtio: allocate buffer from parent")

-	bufs_va = dma_alloc_coherent(vdev->dev.parent->parent,
+	bufs_va = dma_alloc_coherent(vdev->dev.parent,

So in term of parent-child relationchip the Loic's patches seem coherent, and don't affect parenting hierarchy
for the rpmsg bus.

So It seems to me that this patch breaks the relationship between the rpmsg bus
and the rproc platform driver, at least concerning the buffer allocation.
But on the other side this patch doesn't introduce regression for rpmsg bus on my platform... 

I probably missed something important because i can not figure out how this patch don't introduce regression.
Can the rproc->dev inherits from the rproc platform device in term of memory regions?

You are right the rproc platform device is now the grand parent of a rpmsg device, while before it was the parent.
Anyway, does it makes sense to have this kind of dependency between rpmsg device and rproc device?
The fix could be done in the rpmsg device that would be rproc dependent (if out-of-tree).  
The alternative could be to declare the rpmsg device in device tree as child of the rproc platform device...

Arnaud
