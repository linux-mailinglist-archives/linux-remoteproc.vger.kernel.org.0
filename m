Your patch is correct, we need to cdev_add() and in particular assign
dev->devt before calling device_add(). Given how the code is split in
core and cdev there's no way to use cdev_device_add(), but I don't think
anyone is suggesting that - except for your commit message.

So while everything you mention in your commit message seems correct,
you should be able to make it more to the point by distilling it down to
something like:

  The cdev needs to be added and devt assigned before device_add() is
  called in order for the relevant sysfs and devtmpfs entries to be
  created and the uevent to be properly populated.

So it works for e.g. systemd based systems (most of the time), while in
a system based on devtmpfs the dev node would never show up.
