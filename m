Right, similar to Guennadi's version, if we want to keep it simpler this is
probably the preferred option.
From my point of view the main requierement is that the ns announcement service
is generic.

Used in DRM framework mainly, i implemented this in my RFC[1] concerning the
refactoring of the rproc_virtio in a platform driver. The idea was to ensure
that all rproc sub-devices are registered before starting the remote processor.

[1]https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/4/16/1817

The principle it to attach child components to a master component, this
relationship allows to synchronize all using component_master_add_with_match
and component_bind_all after the drivers probing step.
The drawback of this solution is that it make code more complex.

Time is always a major issue :) 
No time this week, but i will try to send patches next week.
