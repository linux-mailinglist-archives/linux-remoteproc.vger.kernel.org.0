Yes, that will not change with the introduction of this change.

I made a mistake earlier, QMI is the layer that creates a QRTR
based socket over glink, and is not going to understand how the
socket works internally (think of an application creating a TCP
socket). The change makes it so that the glink layer is torn
down before.

The subdevice concept serves the purpose of informing devices
like glink when the remoteproc goes down. It makes the entire
concept redundant if the subdevices need to check if the
remoteproc is up or not.

I will agree with you if you call this change ugly (because it
is), but I don't think this should break anything for anyone.
If subdevices are independent of each other the order in which
subdevice stop()/unprepare() is called becomes irrelevant.

In case they are dependent, for example - A(SSR)->B(glink), we
would call B start() before calling A start() since A cannot work
without B. During tear down unless B stop() is called A will
continue to think B exists, so B stop() needs to be called before
A stop(). Think of the TCP socket example I gave before - unless
TCP/IP knows that the NIC died it will continue to wait for the
other side to respond.

In the case of a normal/clean shutdown the users of the
remoteproc should cleanup their side of the resources before
informing the remoteproc framework to shutdown the remoteproc.
Reference counting in the framework will ensure that a remoteproc
framework isn't shutdown randomly unless it is a crash.
