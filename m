Subject: [PATCH] hwspinlock: fix some comments about 'will never sleep'
Date: Thu, 26 Sep 2024 10:30:28 +0800

Both __hwspin_trylock and __hwspin_unlock use hwlock->lock,
with a special annotation:
function will never sleep.
However, this requirement is not fulfilled on PREEMPT_RT.

Bjorn said:
: "will never sleep" comment expresses that the function can be called
: in atomic or irq context, not necessarily that it must not sleep.

This patch fixes these comments.
