Sorry for doing that, I thought I moved the file first as you instructed bu=
t
I didn't understand that I should also not reword the sentences that convey
the same meaning. Will keep the text of below content in the same file:
1. Introduction
2. Binary Firmware Structure: will just add example as shown in this patch.
3. Virtio and remoteproc: didn't change anything in the patch for this.

For below:
1. User API:
2. Typical usage:
3. API for implementors :

Should I just move all of the above text as it is to
remoteproc-kernel-api.rst or
you prefer here as I feel it belongs there?
