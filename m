I'm not able to read out from these two flows where there would be a
race condition. You're describing things that happens in process A and
then you're describing things in processes B, but I think you're
expecting the reader to deduce what the actual problem is from those
-EINVAL lines in Process-A - or I'm completely failing to see what
problem you're solving here.

Above you tried to describe a race condition, but this is talking about
something else.

I totally agree with this statement, but I find it to come out of
nothing.

Yes! But there is a race condition?

This on the other hand, seems to be a real problem - but I don't think
it's a race condition.

You haven't established why the restrictive state would be needed.


In fact, I don't think you have a race condition, because I think it can
be 20 minutes between the "mutex_unlock()" and your "echo enabled" and
you would see exactly the same problem.

If I interpret pieces of your commit message and read the code, I think
you're solving the problem that

rproc_crash_handler_work()
  rproc_trigger_recovery()
    rproc_boot_recovery()
      rproc_stop()
        rproc_stop_subdevices()
          glink_subdev_stop()
            qcom_glink_smem_unregister(glink->edge)
              deref(glink->edge)
            glink->edge = NULL;
        rproc_ops->stop() // returns -EINVAL
        // rproc_unprepare_subdevices never happens
        // rproc->state = OFFLINE never happens

// rproc left in CRASHED state

rproc_recovery_write()
  rproc_trigger_recovery()
    rproc_boot_recovery()
      rproc_stop()
        rproc_stop_subdevices()
          glink_subdev_stop()
            qcom_glink_smem_unregister(glink->edge)
              deref(glink->edge) // glink is NULL -> oops


Or in English, stopping the remoteproc fails, but we've already stopped
the subdevices and when we then try to recover a second time, we fail to
stop the subdevice.

This does sound familiar, to the point that I believe we've talked about
this in the past, and perhaps that's where the idea of a new state
you're talking about is coming from? Unfortunately I don't remember the
details, and the future reader of the git history surely won't
remember...

This does make glink_subdev_stop() idempotent, but do we guarantee that
the rest of the involved callstack handles this as well? Is it
documented somewhere that any changes to the framework or remoteproc
drivers need to maintain this property - or does it just happen to work
today?



The commit message needs to be rewritten so that a 3rd party can read it
and understand what problem it solves.

Under what circumstance does qcom_pas_stop() fail, and in what
circumstances would it work again a little bit later? Why do we get
-EINVAL here?

I fully agree with you that we should do our very best to recover the
crashed remoteproc, to the point that I wonder who will actually trigger
this bug? In what circumstance would a user go and manually enable
recovery on a remoteproc with recovery already enabled, to dislodge it.

I think we should fix the root cause, because that's what all the users
and 99% of the developers will hit. Very few will attempt a manual
recovery.

If we then consider attempting a manual recovery after the recovery has
failed, then we need to document that all parts of the stop must be
idempotent - in which case this patch would be part of that
implementation.
