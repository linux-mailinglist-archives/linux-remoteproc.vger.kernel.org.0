Dynamic memory allocation based on packet size would make the implementation
quite complex, and I don't remember any virtio device that do this.

I think Xiao's proposal in [1] was on the right track.  There were a few things
to adjust like the type used in the rpmsg_config structure (_u32 rather than
le32), the lack of a version number and the problem generated by the double
memory allocation.  The latter should likely be cobbled in a single allocation.

That said it leaves no room for error about the size of the rx and tx buffers.

Lastly, any implementation needs to be standard with enhancements to the rpmsg
config space accepted by OASIS. 

I hope this is enough to move forward - let me know if it isn't the case.
