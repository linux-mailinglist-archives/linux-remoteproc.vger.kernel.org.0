Yes, I definitely had enough time.

I did see that you and Mathieu had reached an agreement on the patches
and set out to apply the patches.

But as I look at the patches I realize that you're refactoring the
entire design of how rpmsg_char works and last time we spoke about the
existing users I got the feeling that you had no way to validate that
they still work after this refactoring. And in those discussions I
highlighted a few things that would break existing users.

So I felt the need to convince myself that your series does indeed not
break existing users.

Unfortunately I dropped the ball on getting back to do this.

The change is complex, affects existing users, it introduces new ABI and
that I don't believe Mathieu has the means of testing the existing
users(?). So while I trust Mathieu's R-b, I did want to take one more
look at it.

I'll make sure to carve out the necessary time in the coming days to go
through the patches and let's take it from there.

You have 9 patches over 3 different series in different versions, where
things certainly depend on each other.

I believe I asked you if we could do this step-wise, I didn't mean that
we should split it in multiple steps that needs to be taken at the same
time...

Then you have this, which I thought was related to the others when I
browsed through the patch list, and therefor didn't merge. But now that
I look again I see that this is unrelated.

I've added the appropriate Fixes tag and picked this up now.

Bjorn
