I think the patch properly fixes this regression, but I share your
concern about the fact that we omit an entire category of
shutdown-related crashes from being reported.

The problem I presume with the current behavior is that the shutdown
will race against the crash handler - which might boot the remoteproc up
again while the shutdown is progressing.

So I'm okay with this fix for the immediate problem, but think it would
be nice if we could report the issue appropriately and then finalize the
shutdown.

It used to be that we set one bit in shared memory and sent an
interrupt and the modem would set another bit and interrupt us back when
it was done shutting down...
