Can you please repost dropping the Fixes line, and modifying the patch
description as follows:

dt-bindings: remoteproc: k3-dsp: Cleanup SoC compatible from DT example

The K3 DSP binding example used the root-node with a SoC compatible
property originally to address the dt_binding_check warnings resulting
from using a value of 2 for #address-cells and #size-cells as per most
common usage on K3 SoCs. Clean this up and replace it with a generic soc
node to keep it agnostic of the SoC or board compatibles that are outside
the scope of this binding.

With that,
Acked-by: Suman Anna <s-anna@ti.com>

Please update the R5F binding patch as well similarly. You can retain the
already received Acks.

regards
Suman
