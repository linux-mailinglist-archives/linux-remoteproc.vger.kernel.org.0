The Programmable Real-Time Unit and Industrial Communication Subsystem
(PRU-ICSS or simply PRUSS) on various TI SoCs consists of dual 32-bit
RISC cores (Programmable Real-Time Units, or PRUs) for program execution.

There are 3 foundation components for PRUSS subsystem: the PRUSS platform
driver, the PRUSS INTC driver and the PRUSS remoteproc driver. All were
already merged and can be found under:

1) drivers/soc/ti/pruss.c
   Documentation/devicetree/bindings/soc/ti/ti,pruss.yaml
2) drivers/irqchip/irq-pruss-intc.c
   Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/ti,pruss-intc.yaml
3) drivers/remoteproc/pru_rproc.c
   Documentation/devicetree/bindings/remoteproc/ti,pru-rproc.yaml

The programmable nature of the PRUs provide flexibility to implement custom
peripheral interfaces, fast real-time responses, or specialized data handling.
Example of a PRU consumer drivers will be:
  - Software UART over PRUSS
  - PRU-ICSS Ethernet EMAC

In order to make usage of common PRU resources and allow the consumer drivers to
configure the PRU hardware for specific usage the PRU API is introduced.

This is the v10 of the patch series [1]. This version of the patchset 
addresses the comments made on v9 [9] of the series. 

Two more patch series have been posted ([2] and [3]) that depends on this
series, one has been posted to the soc/ti/ tree and another  
to the networking tree. All the 3 series including this one, has been 
sent as RFC [4] to get comments and to explain the dependencies.

Changes from v9 to v10 :

*) There was compilation issue in v9 of the series because of dependencies 
between 2nd and 3rd patch of the series. Fixed the dependencies in this series.
*) Added enum documentation following the kernel-doc style [11] as asked by 
Roger for 3/6 patch of the series.

Changes from v8 [8] to v9 :

*) Fixed the warnings generated by running checkpatch.pl script.
*) Added Review/Ack tags.
*) Listed just the SoBs tags for all the patches as suggested by Mathieu.
*) Removed a comment for an already documented field in patch 5/6 of this series.

Changes from v7 [7] to v8 :

*) Removed get_device(&rproc->dev) from API __pru_rproc_get() in patch 2/5 of 
this series as asked by Roger. 
*) Replaced all the SoBs (other than mine) to Co-developed-by tags for all 
the patches in this series as asked by Mathieu.
*) Added a new patch (3/6) in this series for Introduction of pruss_pru_id enum.
Previously this enum was part of patch 2/6. As asked by Roger removed this enum 
(and the APIs that are using the enum) from patch 2/6 and added it in new patch.
*) Removed a comment for an already documented field in patch 2/6 of this series.
*) Changed 'pru' to 'PRU' in comment of API pru_rproc_set_firmware() as asked by 
Roger.

Changes from v6 [6] to v7 :

*) Removed example section from ti,pru-consumer.yaml as the full example 
included compatible property as well which is not introduced in this series 
thus creating dt check binding error. Removing the example section fixes the
dt binding check error. The example section will be included in 
"ti,icssg-prueth.yaml" in the next version of series [3]
*) Updated the commit message for patch 1/5 of this series to address Krzysztof's 
comment.

Changes from v5 [5] to v6  :

*) Added rproc_get_by_phandle() in pru_rproc_get() 
*) Provided background of Ctable in the commit messege.
*) Removed patch "" [10] (6th Patch of the v5 of this series)
   as it has dependency on series [2], thus creating a cyclic dependency.

The patch [10] will be sent along with the next version of series [2].
