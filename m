If there is no dedicated pool, no need to associate a memory pool here,
The allocation by default should be done in the global pools if not pool
is associated to the vdev.
Only a global pool assigned to a rproc is not treated as you mention.

Yes you right this supposes that the number of vdev is limited and known, so
not enough scalable.

From MPOV what is restrictive here is the index forced to 0. 
This implementation would impose to declare first the global memory for the vdevs 
then other memory regions (e.g memory reserved for firmware code loading). 
Need at minimum to be documented this restriction...

A alternative would be to use resource table carveout to declare region, but 
this would probably break compatibility with legacy remote firmware...

A second alternative could be to define a specific name for a rproc default memory pool.
and then look for it.

Arnaud
