I considered that (and sent a private e-mail to Bjorn with that
as a suggestion), but as he pointed out, there's a chance this
would include disabling an interrupt that is needed to trigger a
system resume.

Agreed.  I think either the remoteproc driver should handle it
centrally, or all drivers that could be affected by this scenario
should be updated to handle it.  To my knowledge only IPA is
affected, but if it's possible for remoteproc to handle it, it's
simpler overall.

Thanks for the review.
