It would be indeed nice to get this in the WWAN framework.
I don't know much about rpmsg but I think it is straightforward for
the RX path, the ept_cb can simply forward the buffers to
wwan_port_rx. For tx, simply call rpmsg_trysend() in the wwan tx
callback and don't use the txon/off helpers. In short, keep it simple
and check if you observe any issues.

And for sure you can propose changes in the WWAN framework if you
think something is missing to support your specific case.

Loic
