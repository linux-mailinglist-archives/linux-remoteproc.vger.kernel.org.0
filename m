I'm personnaly following this thread, our project is to be able to do RPC call
from Linux to an RTOS (Zephyr). Our plan is to do that in userspace using the nameservice
announcement from virtio/rpmsg.

We did an hackish patch to do that internally:
https://github.com/iotbzh/meta-rcar-zephyr/blob/master/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-renesas/0001-Add-device-driver-for-rcar-r7-
rpmsg.patch

That we will be really happy to drop by any cleaner solution.

Thanks for your work !
Julien
