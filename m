The virtio part won't be a problem.  In your case what is missing is the glue
that will setup the virtqueues and install the RPMSG protocol on top of them.
The 'glue' is the new virtio-rpmsg device that needs to be created.  That part
includes the creation of a new virtio device by the VMM and a kernel driver that
can be called from the virtio_bus once it has been discovered.  

Everything in the virtio and RPMSG subsystems are aleady tailored to support all
this, so no changes should be needed.  As for the VMM, I suggest to start with
kvmtool.  Lastly, none of this requires "real" hardware or your specific
hardware - it can all be done from QEMU.
