Right, today it is a limitation of the announcement mechanism. The service is
linked to rpmsg_dev_probe and rpmsg_dev_remove (except if the backend implements
an announcement on create_ept & destroy_ept ops).

The rpmsg_create_default_ept follows this behavior.
As result of this patch, the limitation will exist in both directions.

Another limitation is an ack of the NS announcement to provide the associated
remote address.

Extending rpmsg_ns.c to add new messages could solve these limitations, but that
would be a separate topic.
