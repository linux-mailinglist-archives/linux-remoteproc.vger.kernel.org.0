Hey Rob,
Thanks for the review!

Qualcomm SoCs (starting with MSM8998) allow for multiple protection
domains (PDs) to run on the same Q6 sub-system. This allows for
services like AVS AUDIO to have their own separate address space and
crash/recover without disrupting the other PDs running on the same Q6
ADSP. Add "qcom,protection-domain" bindings to capture the dependencies
between the APR service and the PD on which the apr service runs.

Is ^^ better?

Like I explained in ^^ avs/audio is the only service
that the apr device depends on and is known to run only
in "msm/adsp/audio_pd" service path.

However there are other service:service_path pairs
which will get documented when I add support for more
clients like fastrpc and ath10k.
