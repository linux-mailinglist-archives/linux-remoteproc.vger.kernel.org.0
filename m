Sorry for the late answer...

Prepare/unprepare was proposed by Loïc for the memory management series.
We abandoned it and migrated the memory registrations in parse_fw ops.
So we don't use it anymore in ST.

I suggested the pm-runtime before TI patchset, as it was matching
with Ingenic driver need. 
Now with the additional need introduced by Suman, seems that it is not sufficient
for the K3-r5, due to the memory initialization.

Anyway do we have to choice between the 2 implementations?
Look to me that the pm_runtime could be used to manage the power for the
remoteproc device (and perhaps associated power domain).
While the .prepare is more for additional resources
which ,need to be initialized before loading the firmware (such as some specific
system resources).
