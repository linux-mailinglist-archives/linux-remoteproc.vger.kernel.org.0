That is certainly an idea that is growing on me.  Up to now I used the on_init
flag to express duality in the OFFLINE state.  But based on the comments that came
back from yourself, Arnaud and Suman it is clear that my approach is anything
but clear.  As such I am eager to try something else.

If we add a DETACHED state I don't see a scenario where we need the on_init
variable.  When DETACHED is set by the platform we know the MCU is running and
it becomes a matter of when the core attach to it, i.e at initialisation time or
once the kernel has finished booting, and that is already taken care of by the
auto_boot variable.  

The steps you have outlined above to describe the transitions are accurate.

Yes

Correct.  This is the level of functionality sought by ST and TI.  Xilinx seems to
have the same requirements as well.

That one is a little trickier - see the next comment.

I see two scenarios for after_stop == true:

1) A "detach" scenario as you mentioned above.  In this case the stop() function
would inform (using a mechanism that is platform specific) the MCU that the core
is shutting down.  In this case the MCU would put itself back in "waiting mode",
waiting for the core to show signs of life again.  On the core side this would
be a DETACHED to RUNNING transition.  Wheter the application processor reboots
or not should not be relevant to the MCU.

2) An "MCU reboot in autonomous mode" scenario.  Here the stop() function would
switch off the MCU.  From there the MCU could automatically restarts itself or
be restarted by some other entity.  In this scenario I would expect the start()
function to block until the MCU is ready to proceed with the rest of the
remoteproc core initialisation steps.

From a remoteproc core perspective, both are handled by a DETACHED -> RUNNING
transition.  This is the functionality NXP is looking for.

Yes

Right, semantically "rproc->autonomous" would apply quite well.

In function rproc_crash_handler_work(), a call to rproc_set_sync_flag() has been
strategically placed to set the value of rproc->autonomous based on
"after_crash".  From there the core knows which rproc_ops to use.  Here too we
have to rely on the rproc_ops provided by the platform to do the right thing
based on the scenario to enact.

Using "attach_ops" works for me.  But would "autonomous_ops", to correlate with
rproc::autonomous, add clarity?  Either way work equally well for me.

From the above conversion I believe our views are pretty much aligned.

We can certainly proceed that way.
