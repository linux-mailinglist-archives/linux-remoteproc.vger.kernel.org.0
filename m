Referencing the documentation channel should be more than that:
"Channels are identified by a textual name and have a local ("source") rpmsg
address, and remote ("destination") rpmsg
address."
On the other side when creating an endpoint we provide channel info...
The border between the channel and the endpoint is quite blurred, and can
therefore be interpreted in different ways...

Exemples are not concrete use cases but a projection of what our (mass market)
customers could do with such services.
I have in mind userland services/applications that would dynamically manage the
interaction with the co-processor. some other examples:
- For telematics control, the main processor could create temporary channels for
diagnostics.
- A low power tools that performs measurements using the coprocessor. The main
processor would be activated only to manage a HUI. When the HUI is enabled, the
main processor would be start a rpmsg service to get data and display it.
- more generally, by destroying a service some processing could be suspended on
coprocessor.

The RPMSG_CREATE_EPT_IOCTL do quite the same, it creates a device.
The difference is that the  RPMSG_CREATE_DEV_IOCTL create an additional parent
rpmsg device, while the RPMSG_CREATE_EPT_IOCTL attach this device to the rpmsg
chrdev device.

In term of device creation, the RPMSG_CREATE_DEV_IOCTL does nothing else more
than the NS announcement does.
